# CS-FLEURS (Codeswitched FLEURS)

## Overview

CS-FLEURS is a **code-switched** version of the FLEURS dataset designed for:

* **Primary Task:** Code-switching research.
* **Secondary Task:** Gender-bias analysis.

This is a **short-form dataset** derived from the **CS-FLEURS-READ** subset, which supports **14 directions in total** (`XXX-eng`). In this release, **4 language directions** are provided.

From the original article:

> "...for each code-switched pair, one language, referred to as Matrix,
> provides grammatical structure while a second language, referred to as Embedded, provides words or morphological units
> that are inserted within the sentence. We refer to language pairs
> as Matrix-Embedded; for instance, Mandarin-English refers to
> a Mandarin matrix sentence with English words embedded..."

For all supported directions here, **English** is both the **embedded** and **target** language.
