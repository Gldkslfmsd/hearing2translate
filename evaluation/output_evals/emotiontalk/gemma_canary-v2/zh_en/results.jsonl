Moreover, these models often lack an understanding of world knowledge and common-sense reasoning, leading to suboptimal performance in complex language tasks.\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers are exploring various approaches, including:\n\n*   **Few-shot Learning:** Aims to utilize a small amount of labeled data for model training, thereby enhancing the model's generalization ability in low-resource environments.\n*   **Zero-shot Learning:** The goal is to enable the model to perform new tasks without any labeled data.\n*   **Knowledge Graph:** Used to enhance the model’s knowledge representation capabilities, allowing it to better understand world knowledge and common sense.\n*   **Contrastive Learning:** By learning to distinguish between similar and dissimilar samples, this approach improves the model’s representation learning capabilities.\n\nIn the future, research in the NLP field will continue to evolve toward greater efficiency, robustness, and intelligence, bringing broader application value to human society.", "metrics": {"xcomet_qe_score": 0.7430139780044556, "metricx_qe_score": 1.8337019681930542, "linguapy_score": [1, "CHINESE"]}}

Simply put, this refers to artificial intelligence systems, particularly deep learning models, whose decision-making processes are opaque and difficult to understand.\n\nThis opacity presents numerous challenges. Firstly, it hinders our ability to explain and predict the behavior of artificial intelligence systems. If we cannot understand why a system makes a particular decision, it is difficult to debug, improve, or trust it.\n\nSecondly, the \"black box\" problem also raises concerns about accountability. When artificial intelligence systems make errors or cause harm, determining responsibility becomes difficult. Should the developer, the user, or the system itself be held accountable?\n\nFurthermore, opacity can exacerbate bias and discrimination. If the training data contains biases, the artificial intelligence system may learn and amplify those biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers are actively exploring explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technologies. XAI aims to make the decision-making processes of artificial intelligence systems more transparent, understandable, and controllable, thereby enhancing human trust in artificial intelligence and promoting its responsible use.\n\nTherefore, in today's rapidly developing era of artificial intelligence, resolving the \"black box\" problem and promoting the development of explainable artificial intelligence are of paramount importance.", "metrics": {"xcomet_qe_score": 0.6746107339859009, "metricx_qe_score": 5.86767053604126, "linguapy_score": [1, "CHINESE"]}}

It affects not only the natural environment but also profoundly impacts the sustainable development of human society.\n\nThe primary cause of climate change is the increased emission of greenhouse gases resulting from human activities. These gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, absorb and re-radiate heat from the Earth’s surface, leading to a rise in global temperatures.\n\nThe impacts of climate change are widespread and far-reaching. Extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts, hurricanes, and heatwaves, are occurring with increasing frequency and intensity. Sea-level rise threatens coastal cities and island nations. Agricultural production is affected, and food security faces challenges. Biodiversity is being lost, and ecosystems are undergoing changes.\n\nTo address climate change, the international community has taken a series of actions. For example, the Paris Agreement aims to limit the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Nations are striving to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, develop renewable energy sources, improve energy efficiency, and adapt to the impacts of climate change.\n\nIndividuals can also play a vital role in addressing climate change. We can contribute by changing our lifestyles, reducing our carbon footprint, supporting environmental policies, and raising public awareness.\n\nAddressing climate change requires global cooperation, technological innovation, and the collective effort of society as a whole. Only in this way can we create a sustainable future for generations to come.", "metrics": {"xcomet_qe_score": 0.8329437375068665, "metricx_qe_score": 3.3469033241271973, "linguapy_score": [1, "CHINESE"]}}

There are many methods for numerical integration, such as the trapezoidal rule and Simpson’s rule. The core idea of these methods is to divide the integration interval into several small intervals and then utilize the function values on these intervals to approximately calculate the integral value.\n\nStep size refers to the length of each small interval. Generally, the smaller the step size, the higher the accuracy of the integration result. However, the smaller the step size, the greater the computational cost. Therefore, in practical applications, we need to balance accuracy and computational cost.\n\nTime step is a commonly used concept in time series analysis. It refers to the time interval between adjacent time points. For example, if we are analyzing daily stock prices, the time step is one day; if we are analyzing hourly temperature changes, the time step is one hour.\n\nIn many scientific computing problems, we need to simulate a system that changes over time. In this case, we need to divide the time axis into several small time segments and utilize the system states at these time points to approximately calculate the system's evolution process.\n\nThe choice of time step also has a significant impact on the accuracy and computational cost of the simulation results. The smaller the time step, the higher the accuracy of the simulation results, but the greater the computational cost. Therefore, in practical applications, we need to balance accuracy and computational cost.\n\nIn conclusion, step size and time step are important concepts in numerical computation, both representing the scale of discretization. When choosing a step size or time step, we need to comprehensively consider accuracy, computational cost, and the specific characteristics of the problem to achieve the best computational effect.", "metrics": {"xcomet_qe_score": 0.520322859287262, "metricx_qe_score": 5.947266578674316, "linguapy_score": [1, "CHINESE"]}}

Its effects are widespread and far-reaching, involving multiple fields such as the natural environment, socio-economics, and human health.\n\nThe primary driver of climate change is the increased emission of greenhouse gases resulting from human activities. These gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, can absorb and re-radiate heat from the Earth’s surface, leading to a rise in global average temperatures.\n\nThe consequences of climate change are multifaceted. Extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts, hurricanes, and heatwaves, are occurring with increased frequency and intensity. Sea level rise threatens coastal cities and island nations. Glacier melt and permafrost thaw result in water scarcity and ecosystem degradation. Agricultural production is affected, and food security faces challenges.\n\nAddressing climate change requires global cooperation and collective effort. Mitigation of climate change, that is, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, is a key strategy. This requires an energy transition, the development of renewable energy sources, improved energy efficiency, and changes in production and consumption patterns. Adaptation to climate change, that is, adjusting human societies to cope with the impacts of climate change, is equally important. This includes building more resilient infrastructure, improving disaster warning systems, and developing climate-resilient agricultural technologies.\n\nThe international community has already taken some actions, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement. However, achieving climate goals requires more ambitious and effective measures.\n\nClimate change is not only an environmental issue but also a development issue, a fairness issue, and a social issue. Addressing climate change requires integrating environmental sustainability with economic development, social equity, and human well-being.", "metrics": {"xcomet_qe_score": 0.8916659951210022, "metricx_qe_score": 8.304174423217773, "linguapy_score": [1, "CHINESE"]}}

It is far more than simple greetings and behavioral norms; it embodies profound moral ethics and philosophical thought.\n\nIn ancient society, rituals governed the relationships between people, from ruler and subject, father and son, to husband and wife, and friends – each layer of social relationship had its specific ritual requirements. Adherence to rituals was considered crucial for maintaining social harmony and stability.\n\nWith the development of the times, the forms and content of rituals have constantly evolved, but their core values – respect, humility, and inclusiveness – have remained unchanged. In modern society, rituals remain an important component of interpersonal interaction, facilitating the establishment of positive relationships and promoting social harmony.\n\nTraditional festivals serve as significant vehicles for showcasing Chinese ritual culture. For example, during the Spring Festival, the custom of visiting relatives and sharing a reunion dinner, and during the Mid-Autumn Festival, moon-viewing and ancestral veneration, all reflect Chinese respect for family, ancestors, and traditional culture.\n\nStudying Chinese ritual culture not only helps in understanding the history and culture of Chinese society, but also assists in cultivating personal character and enhancing cross-cultural communication skills.", "metrics": {"xcomet_qe_score": 0.8905926942825317, "metricx_qe_score": 4.042908668518066, "linguapy_score": [1, "CHINESE"]}}

In traditional grammar, \"statement\" is typically regarded as the smallest complete unit of written language, corresponding to \"short sentence\" (短句) in spoken language. However, the nature of spoken and written language differs significantly, and equating \"statement\" with the \"sentence\" in written language evidently fails to comprehensively reflect the actual situation of spoken language.\n\nTherefore, we need to re-examine the concept of \"statement\" and explore its different manifestations in spoken and written language. \"Statement\" in spoken language often exhibits characteristics such as brevity, fragmentation, repetition, and omission; its structural and meaning expression methods are also more flexible and diverse. For example, a simple response like \"嗯\" (èn), \"好\" (hǎo), or \"是\" (shì), although potentially considered an incomplete sentence in written language, can constitute an independent \"statement\" in spoken language, conveying a specific meaning.\n\nIn written language, \"statement\" typically manifests as relatively complete and structurally rigorous sentences, possessing clear components such as subject, predicate, and object. However, even in written language, there exist variations of \"statement,\" such as ellipsis sentences, inverted sentences, and imperative sentences. These variations are simplified in structure, but remain complete in meaning.\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of \"statement\" cannot be simply equated with either written language's \"sentence\" or spoken language's \"short sentence,\" but rather should be a broader concept encompassing both written sentences, spoken short sentences, and fragments. In grammatical research, we need to differentiate \"statement\" in spoken and written language and, according to different contexts and functions, conduct different analyses and interpretations of \"statement.\"", "metrics": {"xcomet_qe_score": 0.6677141785621643, "metricx_qe_score": 10.27334976196289, "linguapy_score": [1, "CHINESE"]}}

Therefore, how to fully utilize the advantages of artificial intelligence while avoiding potential risks, and achieving educational equity and high-quality development, is an important issue in the current educational field.\n\nFurthermore, the application of artificial intelligence in education is not limited to improving teaching efficiency; more importantly, it can provide personalized learning experiences for each learner. By analyzing learner data, artificial intelligence systems can precisely identify their learning needs and weaknesses, and accordingly recommend suitable learning resources and learning strategies. This personalized learning experience helps stimulate learners' interest in learning, improve learning outcomes, and cultivate their ability to learn independently.\n\nOf course, artificial intelligence cannot completely replace the role of teachers. Teachers play an important role in the educational process, acting as guides, motivators, and providing emotional support—roles that are difficult for artificial intelligence to replicate.

Behaviors such as the combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial production release large quantities of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane, exacerbating the trend of global warming.\n\nThe consequences of climate change are extremely serious. The frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (such as floods, droughts, and hurricanes) have increased, posing a threat to human life and property. Sea-level rise threatens coastal cities and island nations, leading to land loss and ecosystem destruction. Agricultural production is affected, and food security faces challenges. Furthermore, climate change can trigger disease transmission and social conflict.\n\nAddressing climate change requires global cooperation and multifaceted actions. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is crucial, which can be achieved through the development of clean energy, improvements in energy efficiency, and changes in production and consumption patterns.

It not only affects the natural environment but also profoundly impacts the sustainable development of human society.\n\nThe primary drivers of climate change are greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activities, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases accumulate in the atmosphere, absorbing and re-emitting heat from the Earth's surface, leading to a rise in global average temperatures, known as global warming.\n\nThe consequences of global warming are multifaceted, including sea-level rise, an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (such as floods, droughts, and hurricanes), ecosystem degradation, biodiversity loss, and threats to food security.\n\nTo address climate change, the international community has taken several actions, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement. These agreements aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote the use of renewable energy, and assist developing countries in adapting to the impacts of climate change.\n\nIn addition to international cooperation, national governments are also introducing policies to encourage energy conservation and emission reduction, develop a low-carbon economy, and raise public environmental awareness. Individuals should also actively participate, changing their lifestyles to reduce their environmental impact.\n\nAddressing climate change requires global collaborative efforts; only through such concerted action can we protect the planet and create a sustainable future for generations to come.", "metrics": {"xcomet_qe_score": 0.7955266237258911, "metricx_qe_score": 12.309566497802734, "linguapy_score": [1, "CHINESE"]}}

It not only affects the natural environment but also profoundly impacts socioeconomic development of human society.\n\nThe primary driver of climate change is the continued increase in greenhouse gas emissions, largely originating from the combustion of fossil fuels, industrial production, and land-use changes. These gases accumulate in the atmosphere, leading to a rise in global temperatures, which in turn triggers a series of climate change phenomena, such as sea-level rise, an increase in extreme weather events, glacial melt, and ecosystem degradation.\n\nAddressing climate change requires global cooperation and the adoption of proactive mitigation and adaptation measures. Mitigation measures aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, for example, by improving energy efficiency, developing renewable energy, promoting low-carbon technologies, and altering consumption patterns. Adaptation measures, conversely, focus on alleviating the impacts of climate change, for example, by strengthening infrastructure, improving agricultural production methods, enhancing disaster preparedness, and protecting ecosystems.\n\nThe international community has already taken some actions, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement. These agreements aim to promote cooperation among countries in addressing climate change.

These benefits can be categorized into four main types: provisioning services, regulating services, cultural services, and supporting services.\n\nProvisioning services include food, freshwater, timber, fiber, and medicines, resources that are directly used to meet human survival needs.\n\nRegulating services refer to the influences of ecosystems on climate, hydrology, pests and diseases, and natural disasters. For example, forests can regulate climate and conserve water, wetlands can mitigate flood disasters, and biodiversity can control the occurrence of pests and diseases.\n\nCultural services refer to the spiritual, cultural, and recreational value that ecosystems provide to humans. For example, natural landscapes can inspire aesthetic appreciation, biodiversity can provide inspiration for cultural and artistic creation, and natural environments can promote physical and mental well-being.\n\nSupporting services are the various processes that are essential for ecosystems to maintain their own functions, such as soil formation, nutrient cycling, primary production, and biodiversity maintenance.

The current iteration feels too linear and lacks sufficient player choice. Consider incorporating more branching dialogue options and consequence-driven actions.\n\nSecondly, the visual style, while aesthetically pleasing, does not sufficiently communicate the intended themes of vulnerability and intimacy. Explore more muted color palettes and consider incorporating elements of visual storytelling to convey the emotional weight of the characters' interactions.\n\nThirdly, the AI companion character’s behavior requires significant refinement. Its responses should be more nuanced and empathetic, reflecting a deeper understanding of human emotion. Focus on incorporating reactive animations and subtle vocal cues to enhance believability.\n\nFourthly, user testing feedback indicates confusion regarding the relationship progression system. The current metrics are unclear and the feedback loop is insufficient. Revise the system to provide more immediate and intuitive feedback to the player.\n\nFinally, please submit progress reports by the end of the week. Let me know if you encounter any obstacles.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Name]\nProject Lead", "metrics": {"xcomet_qe_score": 0.4179827570915222, "metricx_qe_score": 3.2852110862731934, "linguapy_score": [0, "ENGLISH"]}}

These gases lead to an enhancement of the greenhouse effect in the Earth’s atmosphere, thereby causing a rise in global temperatures.\n\nThe impacts of climate change are widespread and far-reaching. Extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts, hurricanes, and heat waves, are occurring with increasing frequency and intensity. Sea-level rise threatens coastal cities and island nations. Agricultural production is affected, and food security faces challenges. Ecosystems are damaged, and biodiversity diminishes.\n\nAddressing climate change requires global collaboration. The international community has reached some important agreements, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement. These agreements aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and assist developing countries in adapting to the impacts of climate change.\n\nIn addition to international cooperation, each country needs to take proactive measures. This includes developing renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, changing consumption patterns, protecting forest resources, and strengthening climate change-related education and research.\n\nEveryone can contribute to addressing climate change.

Firstly, the sheer number of bureaucratic institutions was immense, spanning from the central government to local administrations, with layers upon layers and meticulous divisions of labor. The central level included institutions such as the Emperor, the Grand Chancellor (Zai Xiang), and the Six Ministries, responsible for formulating and executing national policies. The local level was managed by officials including the Viceroy (Xun Fu), Governor-General (Zong Du), Provincial Governor (Sheng Chang), Prefect (Zhi Fu), and County Magistrate (Xian Ling), who were responsible for local administration, military affairs, and judicial matters.\n\nSecondly, the selection mechanism within the bureaucracy was exceedingly rigorous, with the Imperial Examination system as its core. Officials were selected through the Imperial Examinations, emphasizing knowledge and ability, and relatively reducing hereditary appointments and nepotism. However, the Imperial Examination system also presented certain issues, such as the overly narrow scope of the examination content, which made it difficult to comprehensively assess the candidates’ overall competence.\n\nThirdly, the supervisory mechanism within the bureaucracy was relatively weak. Although institutions like the Imperial Censorate existed, responsible for monitoring officials, their power was restricted, making it difficult to effectively restrain the abuse of bureaucratic power. Moreover, collusion among officials and the prevalence of favoritism further weakened the effectiveness of the supervisory mechanism.\n\nFinally, the remuneration system within the bureaucracy was relatively well-established, but it also presented issues of corruption and bribery. Officials received salaries from the state, but some abused their positions to amass wealth, leading to increasing social tensions.\n\nIn conclusion, the bureaucratic system of ancient China possessed both merits, such as the mechanism for selecting talent and the remuneration system, and numerous drawbacks, including bureaucratic bloat, weak oversight, and corruption. These drawbacks to a certain extent constrained the development of ancient Chinese society.", "metrics": {"xcomet_qe_score": 0.5584084987640381, "metricx_qe_score": 2.791121244430542, "linguapy_score": [1, "CHINESE"]}}

These benefits can be categorized into four main types: provisioning services, regulating services, cultural services, and supporting services.\n\nProvisioning services are the products directly provided by ecosystems, such as food, freshwater, timber, and fiber. Regulating services are the abilities of ecosystems to regulate environmental processes, such as climate regulation, flood control, water purification, and pest control. Cultural services are the non-material benefits that people obtain from ecosystems, such as aesthetic value, spiritual experiences, education, and recreation. Supporting services form the foundation for the other three types of services, such as soil formation, nutrient cycling, and primary productivity.\n\nCurrently, the primary ecosystem service assessment methods include the following:\n\n1. Value Transfer Method (VTM): This method assesses the service value of a target ecosystem by transferring value information already available from other regions or similar ecosystems. The advantage of VTM is its relatively low data requirements and straightforward operation; however, its accuracy depends on the selection of the reference site and the reliability of the value information.\n\n2. Benefit Transfer Method (BTM): Similar to VTM, BTM focuses on transferring the actual benefits of an ecosystem rather than its value. When applying BTM, it is necessary to consider the specific characteristics of the target ecosystem to improve the accuracy of the assessment.\n\n3. Market Method: This method assesses the value of ecosystem services using market prices or approximations of market prices. For example, the market price of timber from a forest can be used to assess the value of the timber supply service provided by the forest. The advantage of the market method is that data are readily available, but its limitation is that not all ecosystem services have market prices.\n\n4. Stated Preference Method: This method assesses value by directly asking people about their willingness to pay for ecosystem services through surveys and other means. Common stated preference methods include the Choice Experiment Method (CEM) and the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM). The stated preference method can assess the value of non-marketed ecosystem services, but its results are significantly influenced by survey design and respondent characteristics.\n\n5. Production Function Approach (PFA): PFA assumes that there is a direct relationship between the supply of ecosystem services and the structure and function of the ecosystem. By establishing an ecosystem production function model, it is possible to assess the impact of changes in ecosystem structure and function on ecosystem services.\n\nThe selection of an ecosystem service assessment method depends on specific assessment objectives, assessment scope, data availability, and economic resources. In practical applications, it is often necessary to combine multiple methods for a comprehensive assessment to improve the accuracy and reliability of the assessment.", "metrics": {"xcomet_qe_score": 0.727706789970398, "metricx_qe_score": 1.972362995147705, "linguapy_score": [1, "CHINESE"]}}

These benefits include provisioning services (such as food, water, and timber), regulating services (such as climate regulation and flood control), supporting services (such as soil formation and nutrient cycling), and cultural services (such as tourism, recreation, and aesthetic value). With the continued growth of the global population and the increasing impact of human activities on the natural environment, the recognition and assessment of ecosystem services have become increasingly important.\n\n然而，生态系统服务的评估并非易事。评估过程涉及到复杂的生态学、经济学和社会学知识，并且常常面临诸多不确定性。这些不确定性可能源于数据不足、模型假设不合理、情景预测困难等多种因素。因此，在生态系统服务评估中，进行不确定性分析至关重要，它能够帮助我们更全面地理解评估结果的可靠性和局限性，并为决策提供更稳健的依据。\n\nHowever, assessing ecosystem services is not an easy task. The assessment process involves complex ecological, economic, and sociological knowledge and often faces numerous uncertainties. These uncertainties may stem from various factors, such as insufficient data, unreasonable model assumptions, and difficult scenario projections. Therefore, uncertainty analysis is crucial in ecosystem service assessment, as it can help us more comprehensively understand the reliability and limitations of the assessment results and provide more robust basis for decision-making.\n\n本研究旨在系统地梳理生态系统服务评估中常用的不确定性分析方法，并探讨其在不同场景下的应用。我们将首先介绍不确定性的类型和来源，然后详细阐述各种不确定性分析方法，包括但不限于：敏感性分析、情景分析、蒙特卡洛模拟、贝叶斯分析等。最后，我们将结合实际案例，展示这些方法的应用，并讨论它们各自的优缺点。\n\nThis study aims to systematically review commonly used uncertainty analysis methods in ecosystem service assessment and explore their applications in different scenarios. We will first introduce the types and sources of uncertainty and then detail various uncertainty analysis methods, including but not limited to: sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, and Bayesian analysis. Finally, we will combine practical case studies to demonstrate the application of these methods and discuss their respective advantages and disadvantages.\n\n关键词：生态系统服务；不确定性分析；评估方法；应用案例\n\nKeywords: Ecosystem services; Uncertainty analysis; Assessment methods; Application cases", "metrics": {"xcomet_qe_score": 0.8725175857543945, "metricx_qe_score": 2.5324926376342773, "linguapy_score": [1, "CHINESE"]}}

Among these advancements, pre-trained language models based on the Transformer architecture, such as BERT and GPT, have demonstrated remarkable performance in numerous NLP tasks.\n\nThe core of the Transformer architecture lies in its self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to attend to information at different positions within the input sequence when processing sequential data, thereby capturing long-range dependencies. Compared to traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the Transformer exhibits stronger parallel computing capabilities and higher training efficiency.\n\nPre-trained language models are typically trained using large-scale, unlabeled text data, learning language representations by predicting the next word or masked word. This pre-training approach enables the model to learn general language knowledge, allowing it to achieve good results in downstream tasks with only a small amount of labeled data.\n\nHowever, pre-trained language models also have some limitations. For example, they may perform poorly when dealing with tasks requiring common sense reasoning or domain knowledge. Furthermore, the computational cost of pre-trained models is high, and deployment and maintenance also pose certain challenges.\n\nIn the future, research in the NLP field will continue to explore more effective and efficient language models and will strive to address the limitations of pre-trained language models. For instance, researchers are exploring directions such as knowledge enhancement and multimodal learning to enhance the model's generalization ability and adaptability.\n\nIn conclusion, pre-trained language models represent a significant breakthrough in the NLP field, and they are changing the way we process and understand natural language. Despite the challenges that remain, pre-trained language models have broad application prospects in the future.", "metrics": {"xcomet_qe_score": 0.5481455326080322, "metricx_qe_score": 1.895188570022583, "linguapy_score": [1, "CHINESE"]}}
