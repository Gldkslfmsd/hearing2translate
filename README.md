  The Effectiveness of Speech Modality Integration into LLMs
</h2>

The **Hearing to Translate Suite** provides a unified evaluation framework for assessing how effectively SpeechLLMs, Speech Foundation Models (SFMs), and cascaded ASR→LLM pipelines handle speech-to-text translation across diverse real-world conditions. Covering 21 systems, 13 language pairs, 9 speech phenomena, and 16 benchmarks, the suite measures performance on clean speech as well as challenging scenarios involving gender bias, accents, code-switching, disfluencies, noise, named entities, emotion, and long-form content.
