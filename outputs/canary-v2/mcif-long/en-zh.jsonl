{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 0, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hi, my name is Matthias Lindermann and today I'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multi-set tagging and latent permutations. This is joint work with my advisors Alexander Koller and Ivan Titoff. Compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training. In the context of semantic parsing, testing for compositional generalization The translation of the original text might look like this. As usual, we have a training set of utterances, in this case, the girl slept and Mary knew that the girl slept. These utterances are paired with logical forms that represent core aspects of their meaning. In contrast to standard machine learning evaluation, the test set does not come from the same distribution but contains structurally unseen logical forms. In this example, the model has seen shallower recursion during training and is tested on example with deeper recursion. Naive sequence-to-sequence models struggle with this kind of out-of-distribution generalization and often produce outputs that are detached from the input. In particular, they often fail to reproduce the systematic correspondences between input and output, such as those that are color-coded in the example. A popular method to address this is to integrate trees into the models. The trees are intended to capture the compositional process that relates utterances with the logical forms. This works well, but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures In this paper, we don't use trees and introduce a neural sequence-to-sequence model that directly models the correspondences between fragments of the input and fragments of the output. For the first time, we show strong generalization to deeper recursion without relying on trees our approach predicts the output from the input in two steps first we tag each input token with an unordered multiset of tokens that will appear in the output after the first step we have all the right tokens but they're not ordered that's why in the second step we use another model to predict a permutation to put them into the right order We introduce a new method to predict a permutation that does not put any hard constraints on the possible permutations. This makes our approach quite flexible and expressive. Conceptually, our permutation model works roughly like this. We go from left to right over the output and determine which multiset token to put in every position. For the first output position, we simply select one as highlighted in red. Then we jump to the next multiset token to determine the second token in the output. We determine the third token in the output in a similar way by jumping to another multiset token. We continue this process until every token from the first stage has been visited exactly once. To give you a teaser of the experimental results, here we compare our method with other treeless models on the Koggs benchmark. Our model outperforms the others by a large margin on generalization to deeper recursion. Some other kinds of structural generalization remain very challenging though. In our paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges. First of all, the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data. As a consequence, for a given token, we don't know which multisetter it came from, which poses a challenge for training. In addition, sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data, but the linguistically correct one is latent. We address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training. Our permutation method is very flexible, but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np high. This is because this is related to the traveling salesman problem. We approximate this with a GPU-friendly, continuous relaxation that also allows us to backpropagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations. If you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges, please have a look at our paper or come to our poster."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 1, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hello, I'm Myra, and today I'll be talking about our paper, Marked Personas, Using Natural Language Prompts to Measure Stereotypes in Language Models. This work is done in collaboration with Essender Mouch and Dangerowski. In recent years, many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models, or LLMs. However, these measures have various limitations. They usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate. And they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes, meaning that they do not generalize well to other demographics or contexts, or they simply capture very general, broad and general. Furthermore, most of the work in this space does not take into account intersectionality, which is the notion that multifaceted social identities can aggravate prejudices and be unique loci of harm. To overcome these limitations, we rely on the property that these newer instruction tuned LLMs are very good at responding to instructions and prompts. So we can ask the model to generate a persona, which is a representation of an imagined individu using a prompt like Imagine you are an Asian woman, describe yourself. This can be generalized to any demographic group, because we can specify any identity marker we want in this prompt. So here are some examples of generations from GPT four. Immediately we see that while the outputs are not overly negative or toxic in the traditional sense of these words, there are some interesting patterns. The Asian woman is portrayed as unassuming. The Middle Eastern woman is referred to using words like exotic and referring to a mesmerizing region. And both of the women of color make references to ancestry while the white man persona has nothing of the sort. To capture these patterns, our method has two parts. The first part is generating these personas. Our prompts to generate these personas were inspired by a study in which they gave these prompts to human subjects, finding that by giving them to human subjects, they were also able to bring to the surface racial stereotypes. And also this allows direct comparison between our generated personas and the human written responses. The second part is marked words, which is a method to identify the words that distinguish marked groups from unmarked ones, which I will elaborate on shortly. The benefit of this is that we get really specific stereotypes and patterns with without having to rely on any specific lexicon. The Marked Words Method draws on the sociolinguistic concept of markedness, which states that there is an unmarked default and any group that differs from that default is linguistically marked. For example, the word man or sorry, the word warrior is usually associated with men. So when people describe a warrior who is a woman, they will usually actually specify one man warrior and mark the term with woman. And more broadly, dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked, while marginalized groups are usually marked. So in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are and then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted logods ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group. So for instance for the personas of black women we would do fighting words and compare the logods ratios against both white personas and man personas because those are the two corresponding unmarked groups. Now for some results. So first we use a lexicon of stereotypes and we find that the generated personas contain contain a lot more stereotypes than human written ones. However, when we actually look at the distribution of words in the lexicon, we find very different things. So while the generated personas have much higher rates of words in the lexicon, the human written ones have a much wider distribution of words, while the stereotyp words that are in the generated personas are really just the words tall and athletic. So really only the positive or at least non negative ones. And in fact, this lexicon does not really capture many of the harmful patterns that we saw in the earlier slides well at all. So instead, to do that, we will turn to the results from our marked words method to show how we these positive words facilitate stereotypes and essentialize narratives. In our analysis, we reveal how these seemingly positive portrayals reflect harmful patterns. First, for marked groups, the top words include things like culture, tradition, proud and exotic. And these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm. This contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups. Furthermore, there are many common tropos that are reflected in these words, especially for women of color. So, for example, the words describing Latino women include, we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient. This is connected to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype. And while it sounds positive at first glance, there have been works showing that this kind of archetype is actually very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on the strong black woman. Um, on these demographics to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles. So instead of actually working towards changing those obstacles, it puts pressure on those people to overcome them, which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people, among other harms. Um, more broadly, we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives. So based on these patterns, we conclude with three recommendations for model owners. First, we should, as researchers, be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives. We should also be using intersectional lens to study biases and harms because they are. Because there are many things that might be overlooked if we don't do that. And finally, there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods. Because, for instance, like these positive stereotypes, we don't know if it's because there's some kind of weird, overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other, like anti stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns. We just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency. Thank you very much for listening. Have a good time at ACL."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 2, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hello, I'm James Finch. And I'm Sarah Finch. And today we'll tell you all about ABCEval, a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational AI. This work was done by the Emory NLP Lab, led by Professor Gino Choi at Emory University, and in collaboration with Amazon Alexa AI. So let's say you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares to the current state of the art. The common practice is to use human evaluation, such as asking human judges to select which of the two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a liquid scale. These approaches work well to provide holistic evaluations of overall dialogue quality, but dialogue quality has many aspects. Therefore, you may want to evaluate multiple dimensions of chat quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model at a finer grained level. One approach is simply to ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality, such as the relevance of model responses, using existing comparative or Lickert scale methods. However, we believe that there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation. By explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors, such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself. We call this approach annotating behaviors in chat, or ABCEval in short. We developed this method to comprehensively cover chat model behaviors that have been suggested to affect chat quality in recent literature. ABCEval is capable of measuring the rates at which chat models will commit various thematic errors. For example, ABCEval measures the number of turns in which a chat model ignores its partner or says something irrelevant, contradicts itself or itself or its partner, hallucinates incorrect facts or violates common sense knowledge, and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy. To determine what kind of evaluation is most effective, we selected four state-of-art chat models and evaluated them on one hundred human bot conversations per model using ABCEval. For comparison, we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods: Lickert Ratings on the Turn Level, Lickert Ratings on the Dialogue Level and Dialogue Level Pairwise Comparisons. With the help of the evaluation methods, we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue, since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions. From our analyses of these evaluation results, we found that ABC eval behavior labels are overall more reliable than labels collected by existing methods, as measured by inter-annotator agreement on one hundred doubly labeled conversations. In addition, ABC eval labels are more predictive of the overall conversation quality compared to metrics produced by existing methods, as shown by this simple linear regression analysis. For example, you can see how measuring the proportion of turns with self- and partner contradictions explains five percent and ten percent of conversation quality respectively, while the average liquor consistency scores explain only four percent or less. Finally, we checked whether each evaluation metric captures a unique aspect of chat quality using a stepwise linear regression. You can see how the combination of all ABC evaluation metrics explains over twenty five percent of conversation quality, and as you remove the metrics one at a time, most of them result in loss of a decent amount of information about quality. And the combination of alternative level liquid metrics explains far less of the quality, and fewer of these metrics carry unique information. These reliable, informative, and distinct ABC eval metrics enable us to evaluate conversational AI with a higher resolution than previous methods are able to achieve. You can see in the results of our experiment that several challenges still remain and have been precisely quantified. For example, the bots we tested have common sense violations in around twenty percent of their responses. They produce irrelevant information in around fifteen percent of the responses, and they contradict themselves or their partner about ten percent of the time. With the rapid pace of improvement in the field, many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted. However, this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models. We hope that ABC eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction, and we look forward to seeing how conversational AI will advance in the coming months and years. Thank you for watching."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 3, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hello, my name is Vasudha and I am a computer science PhD candidate at Stony Brook University. I would like to present our work accepted into ACL twenty twenty three as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge. We begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language. Simply put, cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent, such as this example where a person states I know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say I grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting. This belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance. Further mentioning that I don't think I could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a consonance relationship. While dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision making, they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations. So why does this matter? Studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people, track trends and belief values and attitude changes in population. high cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help understand people's mental health better studying dissonance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups finally cognitive dissonance is important to understand personal cognitive styles of individuals and helps us understand decision-making processes better To the goal of creating a cognitive dissonance resource, we conducted a large-scale annotation of dissonance relations. We used a dissonance first approach as seen in the flowchart here. Tweets were passed using a PDTB parser and pairs of discourse units were annotated according to the guidelines that are described in our paper. As can be seen here, dissonance was only found in 3.5% of the annotated pairs. On collecting around 1,000 examples of discourse unit pairs, we ran training for an initial classifier trained only on 43 examples of dissonance. To no surprise, the classifier performed not much better than chance. Given the low occurrence of dissonance and absence of any prior such data set, we are facing the problem of absolute rarity. To alleviate this, we experiment with combinations of transfer learning and active learning to annotate such that more dissonant samples can be collected over lesser annotation rounds, lowering the overall annotation costs while improving dissonance detection. Since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all, we start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks. We transfer from two different tasks. Topic independent dissonance stands classification, a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of PDTB since these two are closely related to the conception of consonants and dissonance and we call them CE here. We find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated data set is already much better than chance with the best with AUC.62. Further, on iteratively fine-tuning on both tasks, we find that fine-tuning of CE tasks followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero shot performance. Thus, this is the model that we use to cold start the active learning. Next, we determine the best method to update a model with new data from each round of active learning and annotations. Cumulative accumulates all the data collected from active annotations so far, whereas iterative updates the model by training on the latest set of data collected. Over the different strategies, we found that cumulative performed equal or better than iterative across the board. Next, to improve the number of dissonance examples, we use a probability of rare class strategy, PRC, to select mostly the examples that are highly likely to be dissonant by the current model at any round of AL. We compare this to the other.. state of the art AL strategies that are commonly used in the community. We find that the proposed PRC strategy works better than other state of the art strategies, although the difference is small. Note that the performance is significantly lower for random. On further rounds of AL with two best strategies, we improved distance classification AUC to 0.75, which is the best performance that we have on the task so far. We also checked the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators. We find that PRC has is a simple ALE strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting ALE with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly. We also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain, whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update. These are the links to our code dataset and our paper. Feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions. Thank you."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 4, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hello everyone, I'm Makshita and today my coauthor Martin and I are presenting our work The Kitmasteff evaluating knowledge integration from multiple sources. This work is a collaboration between McGill University, Mila and Microsoft Research. National language understanding models draw on a variety of knowledge sources, such as knowledge contained in their parameters usually acquired via pre training and knowledge given in inputs at inference time. Recent works in tasks like question answering show that models can use pre-trained time knowledge to solve the task. But natural language understanding often requires knowledge that is also supplied at inference time. For example, in the sentence John saw the newly elected president on TV, pre-trained parameters can contain information about what presidents do and what a TV is, but they cannot reliably know who this instance specific entity John is or who the new president is because the president might have changed since pre-training. Therefore, successful models for knowledge-intensive NLU tasks require the ability to integrate and use both pre-trained time and inference time knowledge. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration. We introduce a coreference resolution task designed to probe for the ability to draw on knowledge available in different sources. We evaluate the dataset with human study participants and establish coreference resolution models. Here is an example from our dataset. Servin is a judge., Kia is a baker. Termin and Kia met at a park. After a long day at work deciding cases in a law court, he was happy to relax. The task here is to identify the correct entity that the pronoun he refers to, which in this case is Sermon. The resolution of a given pronoun requires two types of information. First, entity specific knowledge such as Sermon is a judge. And second, background knowledledge is learned during the pre-training of large language models, while entity-specific knowledge is typically observed at inference time. We vary the availability of these two pieces of information, so that it may either be found in a single source or in multiple sources. We have defined three settings of Kitmos. First, we have the typical setting, background pre-training, where background knowledge is assumed to be available at pre-training time. Second, there is the background both setting, where backgroundround inference setting, where both knowledge types are available only at inference time. This last setting is especially interesting, since it simulates a case where the background knowledge necessary to solve a task is not part of the pre trained data of models, for example, because new occupations have developed since the time of pre training. Here's an example of how we control the availability of facts in the two sources. In the background pre trained setting, we assume that the background knowledge politicians seek elected seats in government is contained in the pre trained parameters. In the context, we provide the anti specific knowledge Chichester is a politician. In the background both setting, we additionally provide not only anti specific, but also background knowledge about politicians in the inference type context. In the background inference setting, we provide the fictional occupation mirror tour instead of politician because mirror tour is unlikely to be contained in the pre trained parameters. We evaluate the data set both with human study participants and establish coerence resolution models. In this figure we show the results of the best performing models on the most difficult variant of the background pre-trained setting. Without task-specific training on KitMus, both models do not perform well. When trained on KitMus, however, both C2F and Berth for Koref perform significantly better than the random choice. This suggests that when trained on general coefficient resolution data sets, models learn to exploit surface cues, which are not useful when testing on KitMus where such cues have been removed. Additional experiments with fictional knowledge indicate that even the best performing models cannot reliably integrate background knowledge provided only at inference time. To summarize the main takeaways of our paper, many co-reference resolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task-specific training. However, with task-specific training, some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources. Still, even the best-performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrated background knowledge presented only at inference time. If you are interested in more details, please see our paper and check out the data set in code on GitHub. Thanks for listening."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 5, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hi, I'm Sarah Pappy from the University of Toronto and Fondazione Bruno Kessler, and I will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with Matteo Negri and Marco Turki. What is simultaneous speech translation? Simultaneous speech translation or simulated is the process of translating spoken language into a text in another language in real time, enabling cross-language communication. And what are the problems of the current simulated models? Specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized, long and complicated training procedures, for example, training involving different optimization objectives, and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes, for example, training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on. So what is our solution? First to use already existing offline ST models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for CMLSD. Use only one mode. We have a number of different models, and we have a number of different models. We have a number of models, and we have a number of models. is below a certain threshold alpha towards the last lambda speech frames, meaning that the received information is enough stable. For example, if we receive a speech chunk containing I'm going to talk about and our model predicts the translation in German and we will look at the cross attention weights, we will see that the first two words points to the earliest received speech frames while the last word points to the last received speech frames as lambda speech frames. This means that the first two words will be emitted, while since the sum of the cross attention is above a certain threshold alpha, we will not emit the last word and we wait for another speech hunk. If we go on and we receive another speech hunk and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross attention weights, we will see that no word points to the last lambda speech frames. This means that these three words will be emitted. If we look at the main results of that, we plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware average lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output. So we want our that they are shifted on the left. And we compare with PREPARA strategies that are also applied to offline models that are the WITKEY strategy and the local agreement. And we compare also with the state of the art architecture specifically tailored for simultaneous speech translation. These are all the results of the simultaneous speech translation strategy on German. And we see that ADAT outperforms all the strategies applied to offline models since their core. Since the curves are shifted toward the left, we also see that if we consider the actual elapsed time or the computational wear time, that is the fastest strategy. If you want to discover more results, read our paper, and we also released open source, the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work. Thanks for your attention."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 6, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hello everyone, my name is Xu Heng. Today I'm going to present our paper Do Kernel 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023? Let's get started. Our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the NER task. We observed that models have been using Kernel 2003 to develop NER for almost twenty years. And this naturally raises several problems. Firstly, can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we do observe poor generalization what causes the performance drop of these models to investigate these problems we developed the kernel plus plus data set this is a data set that we collected from Reuters news from 2020 and then annotated them with the same kernel 2003 annotation guidelines we then fine-tuned over 20 models on kernel 2003 we We evaluated them on both the Kono 3 test set and the Kono  ⁇  test set. And last but not least, we calculated the percentage change in F1 to assess the generalization of each model. So, what is needed for good generalization? Through our experiments, we found that there are three main ingredients that are needed. The first is the model architecture. Through our experiments, we found that the transformer models normally generalize better to new data. The second ingredient is the model size. We found that usually larger models lead to better generalization. And last but not least, we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of the downstream task. Here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization. To our next question, what causes the performance drop of some models? We had two hypotheses. The first is adaptive overfitting, which is overfitting. caused by reusing the same test set over and over again, and this is usually manifested as the diminishment returns on a new test set. The second hypothesis is temporal drift, which is the performance degradation that is caused by the increasing temporal gap between the train and the test data. For data overfitting, we saw that from the graph on the right, the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one. This means that every unit of improvement that we made on column two on kernel 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on kernel plus plus which means that there is no diminishing returns and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift. Our conclusion is that for good generalization, we would need a better model architecture, larger model size, as well as more fine tuning examples, and these goes hand in hand. We can't just have one ingredient but throw out the others. At the same time, we also found that the performance drop here is caused by temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting, even though Kono two thousand three has been used for over 20 years. So going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper, do Kono 2003 taggers still work in 2023? And we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes. We hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalizations of the models. And lastly, please make sure to check out our paper, our data set, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact me. Thank you so much."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 7, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hello! Welcome to our presentation of DeepLean, a new corpus for German text simplification at the document level and at the sentence level. My name is Regina Stodden and I will guide you through the first part of the presentation. Let's first define text simplification. Text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve its understanding for a specific target group, such as people with reading problems or non-native speakers. To train a text simplification model, we require parallel pairs ofirs of texts, for example, documents or sentences. In the example here, you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex German sentence and its translation into plain language. To simplify the sentence, different techniques are possible, as you can see in the example, such as lexical substitution, clause deletion, clause deletion reordering or insertion of words. We now propose our new corpus dplane, because in recent years there were some problems with existing corpora. here are too small to drain a taxonomication model on. The other three models which are proposed in recent years are all automatically aligned, which means they can be error-prone in their alignments. Therefore, we propose our new corpus dplane, which is split into two subcorpora, dplane APA and dplane web. Dplane APA is based on used texts. In Dplane APA, we aligned 483 documents all manually. This results in approximately thirty thousand thirteen thousand parallel sentence pairs. For dplaneWeb, this corpus includes different domains, and we also align all these seven hundred fifty documents on the one hand manually and on the other hand with automatic alignment methods. In total, we resulted in thirty thousand four hundred fifty sentence pairs. We analyzed our sentence pairs a little more, for example on the type of simplification. As you can see here, the Bible texts are much more simplified than, for example, the news text or the language learner texts on all levels regarding, for example, lexical simplification, structural simplification or the overall level of simplification. Furthermore, you can see that our D-plane corpus has a high variety of different simplification transformations. So, for example, in the D-plane API corpus, we have much more reordering and word editions than we have in the D-plane web corpus. On the other hand, in the web corpus, we have much more. more rephrasings. So let's now see what we can do with this corpus. Hello, I am Omar and now I will talk about the use cases for our dataset dplane. So for the first use case we can evaluate automatic alignment methods. In the recent years there has been a lot of alignment methods but in the context of machine translations where we have two parallel documents written in different languages and we want to extract alignments of sentences in post documents but in our use case, we are trying to extract alignments between sentences of two parallel documents, having the same language, having the same content, but they are on a different complexity level. And now as we have our dataset D-plane, which have manually aligned sentences, we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed alignment methods. And we did some adaptations to the proposed methods and we have published all these adaptations and the codes to run our experiments in the paper. At the end we concluded that the best alignment automatic alignment method to use for texts for german text simplification is the method of mass align and you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper. The second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text. We have fine-tuned two different models. We have fine-tuned the model of long import to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base import to produce sentence level simplifications. You can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper. We concluded that this basic fine tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark, a base benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future. Thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference. Thank you."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 8, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hi, I'm Xi Yuan from Fen University. I'm here to introduce our work distinct script knowledge from large language models for constrained language planning. In everyday life, humans often plan their actions by following step by step instructions in the form of guaranteed scripts. Previous work has explored language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities such as make a cake and show that large language models can effectively decompose goals into steps. However, previous work mainly focuses on planning for the abstract goals of stereotypical activities. Planning for the goals with specific goals, specific constraints, such as make a chocolate cake still remains understudied. In this paper, we define the problem of constrained language planning, which imposes different constraints on the goals of planning. An abstract goal can be inherited by different real life specific goals with more difficult. with multifaceted constraints. A good planner should write scripts that are reasonable and faithful to constraints. In this paper, we first evaluate and improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models. Since no data set of specific goals exists to support our study, we have to acquire these goals first. As shown in the table, we extend the abstract goals with multifaceted constraints for human loop data acquisition using instructed TPT. We sample one hundred specific goals and evaluate the scripts generated from Large Logic models. This table reports the overall accuracy of the results. We find that all Large Logic models achieve unsatisfactory results on planning for specific goals. Then we conduct detailed analysis to investigate why Large Logic models for. Results in the figure show that the semantic completeness in generated scripts is acceptable. But the faithfulness to the constraints cannot be guaranteed. We dig into more frank graded topic categories of constraints depending in waking home. The head map in the figure shows that the planning performance of instruct GPDs varies considerably for girls of different categories. Previous studies have shown that the output quality of Larry models falls in high variance, leading to bad performance. Thus, we adopt the idea of overallgenerated Zen filter to improve generation quality. We first show constrained types with examples for instruct GPT and obtain specific goals based on the set abstract goals. Then instruct GPT overgenerates key scripts for specific goals. Next, a filter model is developed to select the fitful scripts. We convert scripts and goals into instruct GPT in bitings and calculate cosine similarity. and similarity scores to measure semantic similarity. In addition, we will write the script that contains the keywords of the target constraint. We only keep the script if the target goal scores the highest in the goal site. With our method, Insight DBT can generate scripts of higher quality. Our method greatly improves the planability both in semantic completeness and faithfulness to the constraint. Since large language models are costly to deploy, it is essential to enable language planning ability of smaller and specialized models. Creating data sets is an essential step to its end. However, previous studies do not enable planning for specific goals, and manual data set annotation is expensive. Thus, we follow the idea of symbolic knowledge distillation to distill constrained language plan models. We apply our method for building a data set of constrained language planning named as code script. In total, we generate fifty five thousand specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and test sites. We ask cloud source workers to find and revise the incorrect samples. This figure shows the constrained distribution of code script. We find code script shows the hypothesis in the generated specific goals. With code script, we can train smaller but specialized models for constrained language planning. We find that TFIL function on code rate can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models, indicating that smaller models can support larger models when properly trained on suitable data sites. In summary, we established the constrained language planning ability of large language models and develop an over-generated filter method for large language models. We use large language models to generate a high-quality script dataset, CodeScript, for constructive language planning. We hope CodeScript dataset can be a valuable resource to advance research on language planning. Thanks for your time. Please find more details of CodeScript in our paper."}

In this presentation, we first talk about language modeling in healthcare. Then we will present the main contribution of our article. We introduce the first biomedical model in French named Dr. Berth, which is based on Roberta, and train on Natchios, which is a dataset of medical crawled data from the web. We also introduce a comparison of models with multiple Plutonic settings and data sources. Then we present our result on eleven. The results on 11 biomedical and clinical downstream tasks in French. And finally, we conclude about the experiments and give you more details about how to access the models. Since its release in 2018, BERT has become one of the most effective approaches to solve natural language processing tasks and offers huge performance gains compared to historical static and contextualized methods such as Word to Vector, Fastex or NWO. Since then, this model has been adapted to many other languages, like in French with Camembert and other domains like biomedical with PermetteBERT and BioBERT. and on clinical with clinical birth but mostly in English. Specialized models for other languages are scarce and are often based on continual pre-training due to the lack of in-domain data. However, French did not have any open source model for biomedical until now. So we ask ourselves a question about what is the most appropriate data sources for a wide range of usage. And those current data are a good substitution for clinical data. To answer this question, we compare Dr. Bert with our Schubert model, which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house. Afterward, we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on French data? Is it four gigabytes, eight gigabytes or more? To answer this question, we first train and compare four from scratch models. A first version of Dr. Bert with seven gigabytes of natchos, a second version of four gigabytes of natchos, a first version of Schubert, which is a clinical model with four gigabytes of sentences taken from clinical nodes, and a final version of Schubert with a mix of four gigabytes of natchos and four gigabytes of clinical nodes. In addition to this comparison, we introduced three models trained on continual pretraining to analyze the impact of pretraining strategy. One based on the weight of Camembert and trained on 4 gigabytes of Natchez. Another also based on Camembert but trained this time on the 4 gigabytes of clinical nodes. And finally, one based on the English biomedical model, Bermud Bert, and trained on 4 gigabytes of Natchez. In total, we have seven models. To evaluate our seven models, we gather match-up public and private don't-seam tasks such as name and altitude recognition. classification, pattern switch tagging and question answering. These models are compared to six baseline models, which are Camembert Oscar 138 GB, Camembert Oscar 4 GB, Camembert CCNet 4 GB, PumedBERT, BioBERT and ClinicalBERT. The evaluation highlights that model performed best on the task with data of the same nature as those on which the model has been trained. However, we can obtain that data from, we can observe that data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile. We also observe that using more data translates into better performance. In general, from scratch frettering seems to obtain higher performance on most of the tasks. However, our experiment on continual frettering using the weight and tokenizer of PumedBeard, trained on the 4 GB subset of Natchez, showed comparable results to those obtained with Dr.Beard 4 GB from scratch, which is not the case for the model based on Camembert weights and tokenizer, which suffer from stability issues. Finally, as a conclusion, our proposed system offers better performance on nine of the eleven downstream tasks and surpasses the result of the generic model here, Camembert. We also observe that specialized data is better, more specialized data is better, but it doesn't scale well. All the pre-trained models obtained from Natchios are freely available on YuginFace and all the training scripts are on our GitHub repository. So thank you for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanges at the post-session in Toronto."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 10, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hello, I'm Xiang Bing, PhD student at the University of Washington. Today I'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks, tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair NLP models. Language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data. Political news media are well covered in their pre-training data. According to a survey of the C four Corpus, we can see that New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, Huffington Post, etc. are well covered in language model training data. This has created a mixed blessing for language model applications. So on the one hand, they were able to learn from diverse perspectives, which celebrates the democracy and the plurality of ideas. On the other hand, these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and may lead to potential fairness issues in downstream task applications. To this end, we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks, specifically by asking the following questions. First, how do we evaluate the political leading of language models and what role pre-training data may have on such political biases? Secondly, how language models with different political leading actually perform on downstream tasks and whether that may result in fairness issues in NLP applications? So, specifically, we first propose to prompt language models with different prompt formats using political questionnaires such as the political compass test. This ensures that we do automatic evaluation well grounded in political science literature. So some preliminary results demonstrate that, first, language models do have varying political meanings. They occupy all four quadrants on the political compass. We can also see that GPT four is the most liberal language model of them all, and GPT theories are generally more socially liberal than BERT theory and its variants. Secondly, we aim to investigate to what extent the political comp biases of language models are actually detected from training data. We conducted a controlled experiment by further pre-training language model checkpoints on six different partisan corpora separated into news and social media further divided into their political leaning. By further pre-training language models on such partisan corpora, we can see that the ideological coordinates of the language model also correspondingly shift. For example, for Roberta further fine-tuned further trained on the left-leaning Reddit corpus, we can see a substantial liberal shift in terms of its in terms of its political biases. We are investigating whether language models can pick up the polarization that is prevalent in our modern society. So we divide pre-training corpora into pre-45th President of the United States and after 45th President of the United States. We separately pre-train language models on the two different temporal corpora. We can see that language models generally had a political leaning that is further away from the center after 2017. So this indicates that language models can also pick up the polarization in our society. So last but not least, we evaluate language models with different political leanings on hate speech detection and Fake News Detection are two NLP applications that often involve language models and could have very significant implications. So we see that if we investigate the performance per category, that is to say if we separate the performance into different demographics or political meaning of news media, we can see a pattern that, for example, for hate speech detection, left-lean language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups, however, are worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups in our society. And vice versa, right-lean language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting white and m man are worse at detecting hate speech targeting at black, LGBTQ plus and other minority communities. Similar trends also occur in detecting fake news, where we see that left-wing language models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political meaning and vice versa. We further show many qualitative examples to see that language models with different political meanings give different predictions to hate speech and misinformation examples based on their social categories. There are a bunch of more examples in the appendix to further highlight that. This indicates that there is a fairness issue that is very present pressing with regard to the political biases of language models. For example, if a right-wing language model were to be fine-tuned on hate speech or misinformation or whatever and deployed to a popular social media platform, this would mean that people with opposite political opinions might be marginalized and the hate speech targeting minority groups might just run rampant without any control. So this sounds the alarm for us to acknowledge and tackle the fairness issues resulting from the political biases of language models. So a little discussion. We would also like to highlight that we expose the unique dilemma regarding the political biases of language models. It's like Between Scylla and Charybdis'. So if we don't sanitize political opinions in language model training data, bias will propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks, ultimately creating fairness issues. If we try to sanitize somehow, we would also risk censorship or exclusion, and it is incredibly difficult to determine what is actually neutral and should retain language model training data. So it's kind of like the electric Charlie problem. OK, great. I think that's pretty much all I have for today. Thank you for your time."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 11, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hi everyone, I'm Coast of Sina and I'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our ACL twenty twenty three paper Language Model Acceptability Judgments are not always robust to context. This is a joint work with John Bakhier, Aaron Mueller, Kanishka Mishra, Karen Fentus, Roger Levy, and Adina Williams. So in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm. So the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments, which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like a acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence the current MPP pipeline basically doesn't allow us to evaluate models acceptance towards longer sentences these days large language models are coming up with longer and longer context windows. So it's crucial that we evaluate the model's acceptability throughout the context window. And that is what we are trying to do here. We are trying to revisit the NPV pipeline by asking the model to evaluate acceptability on longer and longer sequences. So that is the approach. So what we do is that to simulate these longer sequences, we revisit the data sets themselves and then we recreate sentences by choosing acceptable or unacceptable sentences from those data sets. So for example, here we have chosen a typical pair of grammaticality from the blimp dataset from the adjunct island case. And what we do is that to recreate longer sequences and which are acceptable and which has the same matching of the grammatical structure, we extract grammatical sentences from adjunct island and then we add it as a prefix to both the acceptable query and the unacceptable query. So we can do the same thing by choosing unacceptable sentences from the same matching and that could also like be used to test the model's acceptability. And we can also do the same by choosing sentences from a different subset or a different data set. So that is what we call the mismatch scenario. So here the sentences are still coming from relevant data sets, but it's not from the same data set that you are evaluating with. And we can do the same for unacceptability case. Finally, we can choose sentences from a completely unrelated domain, such as Wikipedia. So this will tell us whether the model's acceptability judgments are actually impacted by any context like whether the context is coming from a different subset of the data set or whether it's like completely irrelevant to the current to the sentence that we are looking at so how does the model do so first we look at the wikipedia sentences which are completely irrelevant to the current query pair and there we find that the mpp judgments are mostly robust for arbitrary context length we increase the context length toward up to thousand and twenty four for to max out OPT and GPT two models and we saw here in the orange dotted line, the MPP judgments are relatively stable. Now what happens when we choose sentences from the same data set? So here we are choosing or creating sentences from acceptable and unacceptable domains from the same blimp or syntax gem data set and there we see that the MPP judgments either increase or decrease significantly when you add either acceptable prefixes or unacceptable prefixes. But when we match the structure that is when we choose the sentences from the same phenomena in blame by syntax gym we see a massive increase or a massive decrease in of the MPP judgment for the model depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the MPP judgment trend. Basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain, we see decrease in MPP judgments in similar fashion. So the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences. And the MPP evaluation, the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input, may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window. Please read our paper for more details of our experiments. Thank you for listening."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 12, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hello, I am Dawe, a PhD student at the Sailand University in Germany. In this video, I would like to present our recent work, Weaker Than You Think, a critical look at weekly supervised learning. This is joint work with Xiao Yushchen, Maios Musbach, and Giaz Steffen and Dietrich Clarkov. I'd like to begin with a brief introduction to weekly supervision and weekly supervised learning. In weekly supervision, we do not manually label the data. Instead, we label the data using weekly labeling sources, such as simple heuristic rules, knowledge bases or locality cloudrowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right. When compared to human annotations, the weaker annotations are much cheaper, yet they are also noisy, meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect. If we directly train neural networks on weekly label data, the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize. In weekly supervised learning, training algorithms are proposed to robustly train neural networks on the such label noise so that the trained models still generalize well. In recent works in WSL, so WSL stands for The STestSet stands for weekly supervised learning. A common claim is that people say that they only train models on the weekly label data and achieve high performance on clean test sets. Technically, this claim is not wrong, but there's a catch, which is that people do assume that there is an additional clean validation set available for model selection. We cast doubt on this problem setting, as this implies that additional manual annotations are required in weekly supervised learning. But like an elephant in the room, this necessity is often overlooked. The aforementioned doubt leads us to ask three research questions. First, is clean validation data necessary for WSL? Or can we maybe use a noisy validation set instead? Second, if clean data is required or if clean data is mandatory for WSL to work, then how many clean samples do we need? Finally, should we only use the clean samples for validation or are there better ways to utilize them? We addressed these research questions in our work and our findings are as follows. First, we find that interestingly, recent WSL methods indeed require clean validation samples to work properly. Otherwise, there is a large performance drop. As shown in this figure, if there are no clean validation samples, then the trained models cannot generalize beyond the original weak labels, meaning that the training is pointless. This indicates that WSL approaches actually require cleanly labeled data to work properly, and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked. Our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help WSL approaches to achieve better performance, as shown in the figure on the left. Typically, we only need twenty samples per class to attain high performance. But that's not the end of the story, because if we either way decide to access clean samples, then training on them directly will even achieve better performance. The red figure shows the performance difference between fine tuning approaches, which are directly applied on the clean data, and WSL approaches, which use the clean data for validation only. As we can see, if we have 10 samples per class, direct fine-tuning starts to beat WSL approaches. Finally, the performance improvement claimed in previous WSL approaches can be easily achieved by allowing to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples. As we can see from the figures, the Berliner model termed FTW initially underperforms more complicated WSL methods like cosine. However, if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean samples, then FTW performs equally well as other methods. So in practice, there is no reason to choose more complex WSL methods which require more computation time and disk space. To summarize, we showed that recent WSL approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly. Their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated. Our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows. First, report the model selection selection is done well-clean validation samples. Second, WSL approaches should be compared with future learning baselines as both work on clean samples. Third, continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in WSL. Finally, we have open source our code. You can find it via the QR code on this slide. Please feel free to check it out. Thank you and enjoy the conference."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 13, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hello everyone, my name is Ayud Villar and I will be giving a short overview of the paper Prompting Palm from Translation Assessing Strategies and Performance. This is joint work with my colleagues from Google Translate. Palm is a 540 billion parameters large language model presented last year in 2022. It is trained on a large collection of texts comprising 780 billion tokens. At the time of publication, it achieved state of the art in hundreds of NLP tasks. In this work, we present the first systematic study of large language. We evaluate the translation capability of such models using the best practices of the AMT community. This involves using the latest test sets to avoid overlap of the test data with the training data of the language model. And we compare two state-of-the-art systems, the best performing systems of the WMT evaluation. We use state-of-the-art neural MT metrics and also show expert-based human evaluation results. Finally, we provide some recommendations. for prompt selection strategies. The prompting has a big influence on the performance of the LLMs for translation. As we can see in a simple experiment where we use one short prompting and provide two different prompts for just one sentence. In the majority of sentences, 516 out of 1000, the difference observed is of more than one blur point. And this can go in extreme cases up to 40 blur points. So it's important to select a good prompting strategy. In our experiments, we settled for a five-shot prompting strategy where we just mark each sentence that we provide to the system with the language it's in. So in this example here, where we performed translation from German into English, the German sentences, the source sentences are marked with German colon. and the English translations with English colon. We saw that the actual form of the prompting doesn't have have a big influence in the case of several short prompting. It's crucial for zero and one short prompting, but when we go, as in our case, to five short prompting, there is nearly no difference to the actual form of the prompting. It's the examples that carry most of the weight. The summary of our experimental results is that the example quality is more important than the similarity to the source sentence. So it's important to select the examples from high quality translations. In particular, we compare. the selecting prompts from the training data of the WMT evaluations or the dev data. The dev data is much more accurate and with higher quality than the training data, and the results show better performance when using the dev data. Nevertheless, specialized state of the art systems have a substantial advantage over the PALM translations, but PALM comes pretty close to a commercial system. In our case, we chose to evaluate with Google Translate. The insights that we gain from the human evaluation that we performed using the MQM framework is that the fluency of Palm is comparable to the state of the art systems, but the main difference comes from the accuracy. So in particular, the most common error are omission errors. So it seems that Palm chooses to produce a better sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are omitted in the translation. However, the style outcore category for PAM is lower than for the state of the art systems, which is an additional signal that PAM provides really fluent output, but still with some problems of accuracy. And that's it for this really short overview. For more details, please come to the full presentation of the paper. Thank you very much."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 14, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hello everyone, my name is Jing Wei from the University of Science and Technology of China. It's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video of our paper Are you copying my model protecting the copyright of large language models for embedding and services View Backdoor Watermark. Let's first introduce the background about embedding and services. Currently, large language models such as GPT, LAMA, PELM are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation. Embedding and services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various NLP tasks. For example, OpenAI offers a GPT based embedding API. However, recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding and provide similar services. Therefore, it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services. To protect the copyright of embedding as services, one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider service and detect whether another service contains the watermark. method need to meet the following properties. First, the method should be applicable to embedding as services. Second, the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embeddings. Third, the watermark should be convert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily. Finally, the watermark need to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process. Existing works can be broadly classified into four categories. However, these methods either not applicable to embedding as services or lack of transferability. Therefore, in this paper we propose embedding marker, which is a backdoor based watermark method applicable to embedding as services. Then let me introduce the details of our embedding marker. Embedding marker contains two main steps watermark injection and copyright verification. Before these main steps, we first select a trigger set. The trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval. Assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it. In watermark injection, we first define a target embedding. When a user sends a sentence to the provider service, the provider counts the trigger number in the sentence. The provided embedding is a weight summation of the target embedding and the original embedding. The weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence. When the number of triggers in the sentence is greater than M, the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding. Copyright verification is to detect whether a model behind another service contains the watermark. We first construct a backdoor and a benign dataset. Backdoor dataset contains sentences of which all words belong to the trigger set, while all words in the sentences of benign dataset do not belong to the trigger set. Then the provider requests embeddings from the stealer service with the dataset. The consign and L two similarity between the requested embedding and the target embedding are computed. We compute the similarity difference between the nine and backdoor data set, which is defined as delta cosine and delta L two. Meanwhile, we also apply KS test and use its p value as the third metric. We conduct experiments on four data sets AG News, Mind, SSD two and Erospam. We assume the provider apply wiki text data set to count word frequency. The results on four data sets show that our embedding marker can have great detection. performance while keep grid utility for downscreen tasks. We also validate the covertness of the provided embedding by visualizing the embedding of sentences unfolded as at BOPCA. The legend of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence. As shown in the figures, it's hard to distinguish between the backdoor embeddings and normal embeddings. That's all, thank you. Welcome to discuss with us."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 15, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hello everyone, my name is Ying and my colleague Jian and I will be presenting our research on multi instruct improving multi model zero shot learning via instruction tuning. So with the advances in large language models, many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way. Recently, many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform unseen tasks in a zero shot manner by following natural instructions. However, most previous works on instruction tuning focuscused on improving the zero shot performance on language only tasks while computer vision and multimodal tasks have been left out. Therefore, in this work, we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multimodal per training models can actually improve generalization to unseen multimodal tasks. Additionally, at the time of our research, we discovered a considerable discrepancy in availability of instruction data set between LP and multimodal. There exists more than one thousand six hundred language only instruction tasks. large scale publicly available multimodal instruction task. Therefore, this motivates us to build a multimodal instruction tuning dataset. Here we present multi instruct, the first multimodal instruction tuning benchmark dataset that consists of sixty two diverse multimodal tasks covering ten bold categories. These tasks are derived from twenty one existing open source dataset and each task is equipped with five expert written instructions. For investigating multimodal instruction tuning on our proposed dataset, we take OFA unified. multi modal pattern model as our base model. OFA used a unified vocabulary for language, image tokens, and the coordinate of a bounding box. Here we show some example instances from our multi install data set. To unify the processing of a various input and output data type, we follow the method from OFA and formulate all the tasks in a unified sequence to sequence format in which the input text, images, instruction, and bounding boxes are represented in the same token space. Okay, now I'm going to talk about multimodal instruction tuning. For the training dataset, we use 53 tasks from the NIG group for training and we sample 10,000 instances per task. For testing, we reserve the entire Common Sense Reasoning group for testing and select additional five tasks from WQA and the miscellaneous group. We use all the instances in the test split for each task. In addition, we randomly sample 20 tasks from the test split of NIGO instruction as an unseen task for NLP. So we use a pre-trained OFA large model as a base model. During training, we mix all the instances for all the tasks. Each instance is randomly combined with one of its five instruction templates. So during test for each task we conduct the total of five experiments by evaluating the model using one of the five instructions in each experiment. We report the mean and max performance and the standard deviation of the performance across all five experiments. If the task is a multi-model classification task, we report accuracy. If it's a multi-model generation task, we report ROOGEL. For an RP task, we report ROOGEL as well. We also introduced additional evaluation metric called sensitivity. So this measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task regardless of slight variation in the wording of the instruction. Here is our main result. As we can see, instruction tuning can significantly improve OFA's performance on seeing multi-model tasks. Also, transfer learning from natural instruction data set can benefit instruction tuning. Here we can see as the amount of task increase the model achieve better performance and in the meantime lower sensitivity. So we also did one experiment. In the experiment, we used one instruction versus five instructions. As we can see, using more instructions can improve the model's overall performance and reduce its sensitivity a lot. This shows the effect of different fine tuning strategies on the model's sensitivity. As we can see, by transfer learning from natural instruction dataset, the model can achieve much better sensitivity compared to the original OFA model. We can also see that transfer learning from natural instruction dataset can help OFA achieve much better performance on the natural instruction dataset. So, in general, we propose the first large-scale multi-model instruction tuning data set. We significantly improve the DirecTrack capability of OFA and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits. We design a new metric called sensitivity. So one more thing, we are collecting a much larger multi-model instruction tuning data set with around 150 additional Variant language tasks and we will release them. So this is a QR code for our data and model. Thank you."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 16, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hello everyone, my name is Yusen Zhang from the Penn State University. Today I'm going to present our work, Exampler, Crosslingual Semantic Parsing in multiple natural languages and meaning representations. So, semantic parsing is a task to build semantic representations of user queries such as SQL and Lambda calculus. And crosslingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations. As shown in this figure, we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to SQL, Lambda or FunQL. or functional and etc existing cross-lingual semantic parsing models are separately proposed and evaluated on data set of limited tasks and applications for instance there are leaks of um coverage on certain natural language the chinese is missing and leaks of coverage on certain many representations the lambda calculus is missing or they're only evaluated on certain newer models for example there's only one single model to evaluate them so to this end we propose exampler we provide a uniform data set exampler for cross-lingu semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and meaning representations. It contains nine data sets in various domains, five semantic parsing taxes, eight meaning representations, and 22 natural languages in 15 language families. And to better evaluate our benchmark, we consider the six settings for training and evaluation. The first one is TranslateTest. We use Google Translate API to translate source to the target language, then use monolingual model to train and evaluate. And for example, we train the English model on... on English query and during inference we translate the German query using API to English and then use the trained model to predict the SQL. And we also test monolingual model. In this setting, the source language is the same as target language. For example, German to German or English to English. We also test monolingual fusion setting by training monolingual models with only 10% of training data. And we test monolingual multilingual model, which we train one multilingual model for all languages. For example, we We put the German, English, and Chinese queries together to train a multilingual model and during inference we can use this model to translate German queries or Chinese queries or etc. And we also consider crosslingual zero shot and field shot transfer. We train on one source language and transfer to another language. So during training we train on English query or the combination of English and German field shot queries to train a multilingual model and predict the SQL output. We also found many interesting results. So regarding the analysis of monolingual models, we evaluated on two groups of models, including Encoder PDR, which stands for multilingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders, such as XLMR plus PDR and BERT plus PDR. And we also evaluated encoder decoder models, which is multilingual pre-trained encoder decoder models, such as MBART and MT5. We found that encoder decoder obtains the best performance on all nine datasets. We evaluated on MT5 and XLMR plus PDR on multilingual setting. We found that encoder decoder or encoder PDR can be improved by training in a mixture of various languages. And we found that this is because most of the major natural languages can obtain performance gain, except that English performance drops in seven datasets and only gains in three datasets. I think this is known as the curves of multilinguality. We also compared the cross-lingual performance gap. In this figure, the blue line is cross-language fuchsia transfer. The orange line is cross-language zero-shot transfer. While the green line is the monolingual setting, we found that by comparing the green and orange line, we found that for zero-shot setting, the cross-language transfer performance gap is significant. And by comparing blue and orange line, we found that for fuchsia setting, the transfer gap is shortened rapidly. We also find some other interesting findings. For example, encoder-decoder outperforms progress work or achieves comparable results. Virtuating on English natural language can significantly boost the We have found that multilingual language models, such as Codus and Bloom, are still inadequate for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks. In summary, we have built Exemplar, a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative types of multilingual language models. Our results show many interesting findings and so on. Welcome to visit our paper and code.

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 17, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hi, my name is Adam Spirakowski and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination. As you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches. So for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordinate coordination Lisa, Bart and Maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure. So in this case Lisa. A similar approach is assumed in Igor Milchuk's meaning text theory where again the whole coordinate structure is headed by the first conjunct. So these two approaches are asymmetric, right? They single out one of the conjuncts. Now there are also symmetrical approaches to coordinate structures such as the prague approach, the conjunction headed approach assumed in prague dependency tree banks where coordinate structures are headed by the conjunction. So we get dependencies from and to all the conjuncts. And finally there's also a multi-headed approach that's used for example in the Cutson's word grammar where so to say all conjuncts are heads of the coordinate structure so we get dependencies from the governor here laughs to all conjuncts separately these are bart and making now the aim of this paper is to is to produce a novel argument for the symmetric structures of coordination like these two and against the asymmetric structures of coordination like these two. Okay, the argument is based on the principle of dependency length minimization that I will explain on the basis of these examples. So in English, as you might know, direct objects prefer to be close to the verb while adjuncts may be further away, right? So March read it yesterday is fine because the direct object it is close to the verb, while March read yesterday it is much worse, right? Because here between the verb and the direct object there is an adjunct yesterday however this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine march read this absolutely fascinating book about the bees yesterday is okay where instead of it we have this long np but it's also okay to say march read yesterday this absolutely fascinating book about bees so the reasoning here is that this is possible because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that direct objects should be next to the verb it satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization which says that shorter shorter dependencies are preferred so these two trees only show the length of the crucial dependencies so the ones that are not constant among these two structures so here we have a dependency from red to the adjunct of length 7 measured in words and from red to book of length 4 so together it's 11 when you move when you swap these two constituents the sum of these two dependencies becomes six right so instead of 11 six much shorter that's why this sounds quite okay right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one Okay, so what we did, we extracted various statistics about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and see the paper why we didn't use universal dependencies. And these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter. So salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables. And also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length the length difference so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows the shorter conjuncts prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is is bigger of the left short conjuncts But what's novel in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left or absent. So the governor is on the left in this example. I saw Bart and Lisa. So is the governor? It's on the left. It's absent in the second example homer came and sneezed here we have coordination of two verbs and there's no outside external governor right so in such cases the left conjunct prefers to be shorter the more so the the bigger the difference between the two conjuncts however when the governor is on the right as here left governs the coordination ted and net this effect disappears so we show that by measuring length in characters, that's the first column, in syllables, the middle column, and in words, the right column. So I'll concentrate on the right one. What we see here is that when the governor is on the left, the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two. So see the paper for the full agreement and arguments sorry and talk to us about at the post-session. Thank you."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 18, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hello, my name is Kyo Yin and I will present our work titled When Does Translation Require Context? A Data Driven Multilingual Exploration. This work was done in collaboration with Patrick Fernandes, Emily Liu, Andre FD Martins and Graham Newbig. So many translations depend on the context. For example, how would we translate mole in this sentence? Well, if the previous sentence was Things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out, then mole refers to a spy. But if the previous sentence was Could it be anything serious, doctor? then mole refers to a birthmark. So, depending on the context, the meaning of the word changes, and therefore its translation also changes. However, it is quite difficult to evaluate how well models can translate cases like this. Firstly, because only a small proportion of translations depend on the context, which makes corpus level metrics like Blue unable to capture these translations. And some people have suggested targeted evaluation on context dependent translations, but these resources support only limited types of context dependent translations and limited sets of languages, since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation. In this work, we tried to answer these two questions. First, when does translation require context? And second, how well do models handle these cases? To answer the first question, we started by measuring how much a word depends on context during translation. In the previous work, we introduced CXMI as a measure for context usage by machine translation models. And this is done by measuring how much information the context C provides about the target Y given the source X. You can think of CXMI as the information obtained from giving context to the model. In this work, we extend CXMI to pointwise CXMI, which can measure the context usage at the sentence level or at the word level. We can think of words that have high PCXMI as those that require context for translation. Now we analyze words with high PCXMI to look for patterns between these words. And we perform our analysis on transcripts of TED Talks that have been translated from English to fourteen different languages. We perform our analysis at three different levels. First, we look at parts of speech tags that have high means PCXMI. This allows us to find, for example, dual pronouns in Arabic that have relatively high p six mi. This can be explained because English does not have dual pronouns. Therefore, you need context to determine whether a pronoun is dual when translated into Arabic. Similarly, we find that certain languages also require context when we want to choose the appropriate verb form. We then look at vocabulary items that have high p six mi averaged over all its different occurrences. And this helps us identify cases like the one here where in Chinese you need context to translate properly. And finally, we look at different individual tokens that have high p6mi. And this allows us to identify phenomena that cannot really be captured by the word itself, but that's rather expressed in the sentence structure, such as ellipsis resolution. So now we use our findings from our analysis to design a benchmark for document level translation. For each of the five discourse phenomena we identified, we create taggers to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon, and we call our tagger the Multilingual Discourse Aware or MUDA tagger. We can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena. We then use the MUDA tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation, and we apply our translation metrics of choice on the context-dependent examples that the MUDA tagger has identified. Finally, we use our benchmark, as well as other metrics, to evaluate different models on machine translation at the document level. First of all, when we use corpus level metrics, so for Blue we find that context-agnostic models have the best performance, but then if we use comet, context-aware models perform best. And if we use WordF measure, then models with or without context have comparable performance. This again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best document level translation system if we use cor the MUDA benchmark to evaluate models and we find that context-level models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context for certain discourse phenomena, such as formality and lexical cohesion. But these models are not much better than models that do not use context for other phenomena, such as ellipses, pronouns and verb form. So this suggests where we would need to see more progress for document level translation. We also compared different commercial systems and our benchmark shows that DPL is usually more accurate. Google Translate is usually more accurate than Google Translate for document level translation. In summary, we perform a data-driven analysis across fourteen language pairs to identify when translations require context. And then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document level machine translation, which can help us identify which discrete phenomena models can handle well or not, and which translation systems are good at document level translation. Thank you very much for your attention. See you tomorrow."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 19, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hello everyone, I'm Jenny, a PhD student of the first year at Carnegie Mellon University, and today I'll be presenting your work, Characterizing Design Biases, A Beta Sets and Models. This work was done in collaboration with some people at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI, namely Sebastian Santi, Ronin Lebras, Katarina Reinicke and Martin Sapp. So let's start by imagining that you are working for a newspaper and you are sifting through comments under your news article trying to remove toxic content. You might turn to a popular API, such as Perspective API for Toxicity Detection, and this works really well if you are Carl Jones., where Perspective APIs are able to correctly detect toxic instances. But this is not really the case for Dithya Sharma, where Perspective APIs are not really as sensitive to offensive terms that are more common in Indian contexts. This is an example of a design bias where we see systematic performance differences of technology between populations. Design biases like the one we just saw before may occur due to the positionality of the NLP researchers and model developers. Positionality is simply the perspectives that people hold as a result of their demographics, identity and life experiences. This is a concept widely used in critical studies, specifically in feminist and queer academic spaces. And as a researcher, positionality can influence the research process and its outcomes and results, because it can change the decisions that researchers make. And so one question that people might ask is, do datasets and models have positionality? And we are not trying to say that models themselves and datasets themselves have demographic identities and life experiences, but they aggregate judgments and opinions of real people and can thus represent certain positionalities over others. Previous works have suggested some anecdotal evidence of having positionality, such as cultural gaps in models and datasets, as well as theoretical definitions of model positionality. However, these works do not really look at comparing end users with the datasets and models themselves. And studying model and dataset positionality is increasingly important as NLP tasks become more subjective and socially oriented. And it is challenging to characterize how these positionalities are skewed because not all decisions are documented and many models are hidden behind APIs. To study data set and model positionality, we actually compare the annotations with real users with existing data sets and models. We do this through our framework NLPositionality. Our framework works in two main steps. The first step is to re-annotate data sets with diverse annotators. And we opt to do this by looking at the demographics of original data sets, annotators, because usually only a few annotators annotate each instance and because demographics are rarely collected and shared. Therefore, we opt for reannotating data to obtain many annotators per instance and to obtain a rich set of demographic data. We then take the annotations by demographic data and compare them with the models and datasets using a Parsons R correlation score. And thus, our framework differs from the annotator disagreement literature by comparing end users with models and datasets, predictions and labels, instead of looking at just annotator agreement or modeling annotator distributions. Our framework is largely enabled through Lab in the Wild, an online experimental platform where we can recruit diverse volunteers compared to platforms like MTurk, which have participants from the USA or India. Furthermore, Lab in the Wild is still able to obtain high-quality data. We host two tasks on Lab in the Wild, one of which is social acceptability. And the way this works is that participants will read a situation from the social chemistry data set and then they will write how socially acceptable a situation is. Afterwards, to stay engaged in the study, they can compare their responses to an AI and others. We then compared these annotations with Social Chemistry Delphi in GPT four. We then replicated a very similar setup for the toxicity and hate speech detection task, where they will read an instance from DynaHate and write whether they think it is an instance of hate speech. We then compared these annotations with DynaHate, Perspective API, Rewire API, Hate Roberta in GPT four. Our study, in the end, accumulated over sixteen thousand annotations from over a thousand annotators from eighty seven countries. So now we are better equipped to answer who do NLP datasets and models align the most with? We find that there is positionality in NLP. For example, we find that datasets and models are most aligned with English-speaking countries. So for the GPD four, social acceptability analysis, we find that it is most aligned with Confucian and English-speaking countries. We find that DanaHate is also most aligned with English-speaking countries. We also find most additional alignment with people who have a college education. So for GPD four in the social acceptability task, we find that it is most aligned with people with a college education or graduate school education. And we find the same for DanaHate, where it is most alignedned with people with a college education. However, when models and datasets are aligned with specific populations, some are inevitably left behind. An example of this is that datasets and models are less aligned with non-binary people compared to their male and female counterparts. We find this in the GPT four Social Acceptability Task as well as in the DynaHate Task Analysis. So, given that there is positionality in NLP, what can we do about it? So we have a few recommendations for this. The first is to keep a record of all relevant design choices. throughout the research process. And the other is to do NLP research through the lens of perspectivism. Our third recommendation is to build specialized datasets and models within four specific communities. And a good example of this is the Musakane initiative. And we want to emphasize that inclusive NLP is not just making all technologies work for everyone. And so that concludes our presentation. But if you would like to learn more, feel free to check out our dashboard for the most updated analysis results and our paper. Thank you."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 20, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh", "output": "Hi, I'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection, in which we introduce the altentity scorpus. My name is Javot Hosseini and this is a joint work with Philip Radlinsky, Silvia Pareti and Annie Luis. Our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice. Consider this alternative question. Did you mean easy on me or I got a feeling? Here a user wants to select between one of these two signs. The most obvious thing is to use a direct reference for example by saying the name of the song easy on me or its position the first one but sometimes an indirect reference is more appropriate to have a more natural conversation this could happen when the user cannot remember the name of the song or the pronunciations are too similar to each other and hard to disambiguate or when the user wants to specify a preference. Here are some examples of indirect references. For example, the newer one or the song that's not an energetic. This is an important problem in conversational systems and also for benchmarking LLM's entity understanding. We're not aware of a public data set, a large-scale public data set for the task, so we collect one using crowd annotation. Our data set covers three different domains, music, books, and recipes. Our data set collection methodology emphasizes informality using a cartoon completion setup. The cartoon has three speech bubbles in the first bubble Bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that Bob sets the dialogue context in the in the second speech bubble Alice says do you mean easy on me or I got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble Bob uses an indirect reference to select one of these entities, for example, the new air fund. We provide the first and second speech bubbles automatically but the third one is filled in by the annotator. The first speech bubble is chosen from a few manual prompts per domain. The second one which is the alternative question is generated as follows. We always use a simple template. Do you mean A or B? where A and B are sampled from Wikipedia. Here are the different sampling methods we've used. When we move higher in the list the entities become more similar to each other and it's usually harder to make the disambiguation the first one is uniform at random the second one is when the entities have similar titles for example two books with the name they return the third one is when they have similar descriptions on wikipedia and finally when they have similar info boxes or attributes on wikipedia for example the same genre or the same artist for a song when we show this alternative question to the annotators they know the name of these entities but they don't necessarily know about the entities so what we do is that we show some background knowledge about the two entities for songs we simply show a google search link to each song and then ask the annotators to listen to at least some of each song and read about each song Here's for example the Google search result for the song Easy on Me. For the recipes and books domain, we show some background text from Wikipedia. For recipes, we additionally show their images again from Wikipedia so that the annotators know how they look like. Then we ask the annotators to pick one of these entities, for example here the first one, and describe them using three to five indirect referring expressions. for example the one with the piano music here are some examples from our data set for example the one without words not the one with the 12-year-old boy or the fictional one or comes from Azerbaijan and so on. The altentities corpus has 6,000 alternative questions across three domains and it has 42,000 indirect referring expressions. Results with T5x large model are summarized below. If the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators, then the accuracy is really high. It's around 92-95%. But this is not realistic if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60 percent so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our data set thanks"}
