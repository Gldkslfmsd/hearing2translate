I think it is very inadequate, including when I watch movies, both domestic and foreign, I also pay attention to the translation. It uses a lot of Chinese characters, and now it can only be in the form of pinyin, but I understand that the existence of some of its pinyin can be considered a form of cultural export, like the current dragon, which is trying to communicate with the outside world not as Dragon but as 龙."}
