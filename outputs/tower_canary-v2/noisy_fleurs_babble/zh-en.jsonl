It emphasizes the importance of maintaining a harmonious relationship between humans and nature, as well as among different social groups and individuals. This concept is deeply rooted in Chinese philosophy, particularly in Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. It is reflected in various aspects of Chinese life, such as art, literature, and social customs. The pursuit of harmony is not only a cultural ideal but also a practical approach to solving social problems and promoting sustainable development."}

It emphasizes the importance of maintaining a harmonious relationship between humans and nature, as well as among different social groups and individuals. This concept is deeply rooted in Chinese philosophy, particularly in Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. It is reflected in various aspects of Chinese life, such as art, literature, and social customs. The pursuit of harmony is not only a cultural ideal but also a practical approach to solving social problems and promoting sustainable development."}
