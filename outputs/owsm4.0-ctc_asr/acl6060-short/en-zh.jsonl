{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 3, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "we' shown examples where multi-step reasoning is helpful."}

{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 5, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So on the left hand side, we can see if we give some samples with just question and answers, we may not be able to obtain the great answers."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 6, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "But if we give some more reasoning description, the model is able to predict the reason description and also make a correct prediction here."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 7, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Um, so it is good to have interpretable multi-step reasoning as output."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 8, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And we also think Math problem is a straightforward application to evaluate such reasoning abilities."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 9, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So here in our problem setup, given the questions, we need to solve this question and obtain the numerical answers."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 10, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, in our dataset, we are also given the mathematical expression, which leads to the to this particular answer as well."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 11, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, certain assumptions also apply, as in previous work."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 12, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "We assume the precision of quantities are known."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 13, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And we only consider basic operators such as addition, subtractions, multiplication, division, and exponential."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 14, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Furthermore, complicated operators can be actually decomposed into these basic operators."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 15, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, previous work in mathematical problem solving actually can categorize into sequence to sequence and sequence to tree model."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 16, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So traditional sequence to sequence model convert the expression to a specific sequence for generation."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 17, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And it is pretty easy to implement, and it can generalize to many different complicated problems."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 18, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "But the drawback of the performance is actually generally generally not better than the structure model, and it is lack of the interpretability for prediction."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 19, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "But actually, this direction is still quite popular because of the transformer model."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 20, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, in tree-based models, we actually structure these expressions in the tree form and follow a pre-order traversal in three generations."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 21, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So here we keep generating the operators until we reach the lifts, which are the quantities."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 22, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So here, the good thing is that it actually gives us this binary tree structure, and it is um but but but actually, it is quite counterintivity because we generate the operator first, and then at the end, we generate the quantities."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 23, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And the second thing is that it also contains some repetitive computations."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 24, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, here, if we look at this expression, eight times three plus three is actually generated twice. But in fact, we should reuse the results."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 25, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, in our proposal approach, we want to solve those problems in a step by-step and interpretable manners."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 26, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, for example, here in the second step, we can obtain this divisor, which is twenty seven. and"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 27, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "can also refer back to the original questions to find the relevant contents."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 28, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And in these steps, we obtain the devices."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 29, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, and then, at this third step, we actually get the quotient."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 30, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "All right, And after these three steps, we can actually reuse the results from the second step and then get the results of the fourth step. and then finally, we can obtain the dividends."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 31, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So here we actually generate the whole expression directly rather than generating a single operators or quantities."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 32, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, this makes the process more accurate."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 33, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "so in our deductive system we first start with a bunch of quantities presented in the questions and also including some constants as our initial state"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 34, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, the expression is represented by e i jP."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 35, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Where we perform operators from Q to q j, and such expression is actually directed."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 36, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we also have subtraction reverse here to represent the opposite direction."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 37, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "This is quite similar to relation extraction."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 38, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, in a formal datative system, at at the time step t, we apply the operator between the Q and q j pair, and then we obtain these new expressions."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 39, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "We added to the to the next stage to become a new quantity."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 40, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, this slice actually visualize the evolution of the states where we keep adding expression to the current states."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 41, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, in our model implementations, we first use a pre-traination model which can be birds or robothoods, and then we encode the sentence and then we obtain these quantity representations."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 42, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So once we get the quantity representations, we can start to do inference."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 43, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "here we show you an example of q1 to obtain the representation for q1 divided by q2 and then times Q"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 44, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "First, we get the pair representation, which is basically just the concatenation between q one and q two. and then we apply a feed forward network which is parameterized by the operator."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 45, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And then finally, we obtain the expression representation q one divided by q two."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 46, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "But in fre, in practice, in the inference stage, we might be able to get the incorrect incorrect expression as well."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 47, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So here all the possible expressions is equals to three times the number of operators."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 48, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So the nice thing here is that we can easily add constraints to control this search this search space"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 49, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "For example, if this expression is not allowed, we can simply remove this expression in our search space."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 50, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, in the second step, we do the same thing, but the only difference is that we the only difference is one more quantities. so"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 51, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "quantity come from the previous calculated expression."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 52, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So finally, we can append this final expression q."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 53, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "times Q4. and we can also see the number of all the possible expression is different from the previous step."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 54, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, um such difference make it hard to apply beam search because the probability distribution between these two steps is unbalanced."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 55, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, the training procedure is similar to training a sequenceto sequence model where we optimize the loss at each time step."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 56, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And here we also use this tau to represent when we should terminate the this generation process."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 57, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And here the space is different from sequence to sequence because the space is different at each times that while in traditional sequence to sequence model, it is the number of vocabulary."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 58, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And it also allows to impose certain constraints from prior knowledge."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 59, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we conduct experiments on the commonly used method problem dataset,MAWPS, Metth3K, MathQA, and Swam."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 60, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And here we briefly shows the results compared with the previous best approaches."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 61, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, our best performing weapon is Roberta deductive reason."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 62, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And in fact, we do not use beam search in contrast obvious approaches using beam search."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 63, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "All right, so the best approaches are often a tree-based model."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 64, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So overall, our reasoner is able to significantly significantly outperform this treebased model."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 65, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "But we can see the absolute number on MathQA or Swam are not really high."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 66, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So refer the investigate results on"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 67, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "wa and this data set is challenging because the author tried to manually adding something to confuse the NMLB model like such as adding environment information and extra quantities."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 68, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, in our prediction, we find some of the intermediate values are actually negatives."}

{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 70, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "But we have some extra information, like seventeen field pitches, and Stephen has eight pitches, which is totallylevant."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 71, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, our model makes some prediction like this, which is producing negative values."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 72, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And we observe these these two expressions"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 73, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, we can actually limit this search space by removing like those results are negatives so that we can make the ah make the answer correct."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 74, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we further find such constraint actually improves quite a lot for some models."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 75, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "example for birds we improved seven point and then for the robota based model we actually improved two points."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 76, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So better language model has a better language understanding abilities, so that the number here is higher for Roberta and lower for for birds."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 77, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "we also try to analyze the difficulty behind this BP"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 78, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "We assume the number of unused quantity can be regarded as relevant information here."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 79, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, here we can see that we we we have the lump the the percentage of samples we unus quantities, and theswaMP dataset has the largest portion."}

{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 84, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, finally, we want to show the interpretabilityities through a crash and presentation example."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 85, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So here, our model actually makes a wrong prediction at the at the first step."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 86, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we can actually correlate the this expression with the sentence here, all right"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 87, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, we think this sentence might be misleading the model to an incorrect prediction."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 88, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So here, printing another thirty five makes the model makes the model think it should be an addition operators."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 89, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, we try to revise the sentence to be something like the number of pear trees are three five fewer than the apple trees."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 90, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, we make it to convey more accurate semantics, such that the model is able to make the prediction correct."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 91, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, this study shows how the interpretable predictions help us understand the model behavior."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 92, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So to conclude our work, so first our model is actually pretty efficient."}

{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 94, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And we can easily incorporate some prior knowledge as constraint, which can help improve the performance."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 95, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And the last thing is that the the underlying mechanism does not only apply to network problem solving tasks but also other tasks that involve multi-step reasoning."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 96, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "But we also have certain limitations."}

{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 98, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And the second thing is that, as mentioned, because the probability distribution is unbalance between at at different time steps, so it's also pretty challenging to apply beam searches."}
