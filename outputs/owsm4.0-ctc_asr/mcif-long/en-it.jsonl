This is joint work with my advises Alexander Koller and Ivan Titov. Compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training. In the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept these utterances are paired with logical forms that represent core aspects of their meaning in contrast to standard machine learning evaluation the test set does not come from the same distribution but contains structurally unseen logical forms in this example the model has seen shallow recursion during training and is tested on example with deeper recursion naive sequence to sequence models struggle with this kind of out of distribution generalization and often produce outputs that are detached from the input in particular they often fail to reproduce the systematic correspondences between input and output such as those that are color-coded in the example a popular method to address this is to integrate trees into the models the trees are intended to capture the compositional process that relates utterances with the logical forms this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we don't use trees and introduce a neural sequence to sequence model that directly models the correspondences between fragments of the input and fragments of the output for the first time we show strong generalization to deeper recursion without relying on trees our approach predicts the output from the input in two steps first we tag each input token with an unordered multi-set of tokens that will appear in the output after the first step we have all the right tokens but they're not ordered that's why in the second step we use another model to predict a permutation to put them into the right order we introduce a new method to predict a permutation that does not put any hard constraints on the possible permutations this makes our approach quite flexible and expressive conceptually our permutation model works roughly like this. We go from left to right over the output and determine which multi-set token to put in every position. For the first output position we simply select one as highlighted in red. Then we jump to the next multi-set token to determine the second token in the output we determine the third token in the output in a similar way by jumping to another multi-set token we continue this process until every token from the first stage has been visited exactly once to give you a teaser of the experimental results, here we compare our method with other treeless models on theCOgs benchmark. Our model outperforms the others by a large margin on generalization to deeper recursion. Some other kinds of structural generalization remain very challenging though. In our paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multi-setter it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is Nphard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a GPU friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster"}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 1, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hi, I'm Myra and today I'll be talking about our paper marked personas, using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models. This work is done in collaboration with Essenndermush and Danjorovsky. In recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models or LLMs. However, these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed data sets that are very time consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups furthermore most work in this space doesn't account for intersectionality which is the notion that multifaceted social identities can compound biases and be unique loci of harm to overcome these limitations we rely on the property that these newer instruction tuned lllms are very good at responding to instructions in prompts so we can ask the model to generate a persona which is a depiction of an imagined individual using a prompt like imagine you are an Asian woman describe yourself and we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want into this prompt so here are some example generations from gpt4 immediately we see that while the outputs aren't overtly negative or toxic in the traditional sense of these words there are some interesting patterns the Asian woman is depicted as unassuming the Middle Eastern woman is referred to using words like exotic um and like referring to a mesmerizing region and both of the women of color personas make references to ancestry, while the white man persona has nothing of the sort. To capture these patterns, our method has two parts. The first one is generating these personas. Our prompts to generate these personas were inspired by a study where they gave these prompts to human subjects, finding that by giving it to human subjects they also were able to surface racial stereotypes and also this enables direct comparison between our generated personas and the human written responses the second part is marked words which is a method to identify the words that distinguish marked groups from our marked ones which I'll elaborate on shortly the benefit of this is that we get really specific stereotypes and patterns without having to rely on any specific lexicon. So the marked words method draws upon the sociolinguistic concept of markedness, which states that there is an unmarked default and any group that differs from that default is linguistically marked. So for instance, the word man or sorry the word Warrior is usually associated with men um so when people are describing a warrior who is a woman they'll usually actually specify one man Warrior and mark the term with woman and more broadly dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked while the marginalized groups are usually marked so in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are and then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group so for instance for the personas of black women we would do fighting words and compare the log godss ratios against both white personas and man personas because those are the two corresponding unmarked groups um now for some results so first we use the lexicon of stereotypes and we find that the generated personas contain a lot more stereotypes than the human written ones however when we actually look at the distribution of the words in the lexicon, we find very different things. So while the generated personas have much higher rates of the lexon words the human written ones have a much wider distribution of words while the stereotype words that are in the generated personas are really just the words tall and athletic so really just only the positive or at least non-negative ones. And in fact, this lexicon doesn't really capture many of the harmful patterns that we saw in the earlier slides well at all so instead to do that we'll turn to the results from our marked words method to show how these positive seeming words facilitate stereotypes and essentializing narratives in our analysis we reveal how these seemingly positive portrayals reflect harmful patterns First for mark groups the top words include things like culture tradition proud and exotic and these words Define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm this contributes to a long legacycy of discrimination and othering for these groups furthermore there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words especially for women of color so for example the words describing Latina woman include things like vibrant and curvaceous which connect to a trope of tropicalism for Asian women the words are things like petit and delicate and silky which connects to a long history of Asian woman being hypersexualized seen as very docile and submissive and so on and finally for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient this connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these demographics to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles so rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles it puts pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there is some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening um have a good time at ACL you"}

And I'm Sarah Finch.: And today we'll tell you all about ABCEV, a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational AI. This work was done by the Emory NLP lab, led by Professor Gino Choi at Emory University and in collaboration with Amazon Alexa AI.: So let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a liquor scale these approaches work well to provide holistic evaluations of overall dialogue quality but dialogue quality has many aspects therefore you might want to evaluate multiple dimensions of chat quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer grained level one approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality such as the relevance of model responses using existing comparative or liquor scale methods however, we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation. Our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors, such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself. We call this approach annotating behaviors in chat, or ABC eval in short. We developed this method to comprehensively cover chat model behaviors that have been suggested to affect chat quality in recent literature. ABC eval is capable of measuring the rates at which chat models will commit various thematic errors. For example, ABC eval measures the number of turns in which a chat model ignores its partner or says something irrelevant, contradicts itself or its partner, hallucinates incorrect facts or violates common sense knowledge, and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy. To determine what kind of evaluation is most effective, we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using ABC eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods liquor ratings on the turn level liquor ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue, since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions. From our analyses of these evaluation results, we found that ABC behavior labels are overall more reliable than labels collected by existing methods, as measured by inner annotator agreement on a hundred doubly labeled conversations in addition ABC eval labels are more predictive of the overall conversation quality compared to metrics produced by existing methods as shown by this simple linear regression analysis for example you can see how measuring the proportion of turns with self and partner contradictions explains  percent and ten percent of conversation quality respectively while the average liquor consistency scores explain only four percent or less finally we checked whether each evaluation metric captures a unique aspect of chat quality using a stepwise linear regression you can see how the combination of all ABC eval metrics explains over 25 percent of conversation quality and as you remove the metrics one at a time most of them result in losing a decent amount of information about the quality on the other hand the combination of all turn level liquor metrics explains far less of the quality and fewer of these metrics carry unique information these reliable informative and distinct ABC eval metrics enable us to evaluate conversational AI with a higher resolution than previous methods are able to achieve you can see that in the results of our experiment that several challenges still remain and have been precisely quantified for example the bots we tested have common sense violations in around 20 percent of their responses they produce irrelevant information in around 15 percent of the responses and they contradict themselves or their partner around 10 of the time with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope ABC eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational AI will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching you"}

I would like to present our work accepted into ACL 2023 as a long paper Transfer learningar for dissonance De detection, addressing the rare class challenge. We begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply but cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states I know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say I grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that I don't think I could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a consonance relationship while dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experienced in daily decision making they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations so why does this matter studying the cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people trackrend and belief values and attitude changes in population high cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help understand people's mental health better studying dissonance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups finally cognitive dissonance is important to understand personal cognitive St styles of individuals and helps us understand decision making processes better to the goal of creating a cognitive dissonance resource we conducted a large-scale annotation of dissonance relations we used a dissonance first approach as seen in the flow chart here tweets were passed using a PDTV parser and pairs of discourse units were annotated according to the guidelines that are described in our paper as can be seen here dissonance was only found in 3.5 percent of the annotated pairs on collecting around thousand examples of discourse unit pairs we ran training for an initial classifier trained only on 43 examples of distancenance to no surprise the classifier performed not much better than chance given the low occurrence of dissonance and absence of any prior such data set we are facing the problem of absolute rarity to alleviate this we experiment over combinations of transfer learning and active learning to annotate such that more dissonance samples can be collected over lesser annotation rounds lowering the overall annotation costs while improving dissonance detection um since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks we transfer from two different tasks topic independent dissonance dance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of puritytb since these two are closely related to the conception of consonants and dissonance and we call them ceE here we find that on transferring the zero short performance on the annotated data set is already much better than chance with the best with Auc 0.62 further on iteratively fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning ofCE tasks followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero shot performance thus this is the model that we use to coal-start the active learning next we determine the best method to update a model with new data from each round of active learning and annotations cumulative accumulates all the data collected from active annotations so far whereas iterative updates the model by training on the latest set of data collected over the different strategies we found that cumulative performed equal or better than iterative across the board next to improve the number of dissonance examples we use a probability of rare class strategy PRC to select mostly the examples that are highly likely to be dissonant by the current model at any round of ale we compare this to the other state of the more state-of-the-art al strategies that are commonly used in the community we find that the proposed PRC strategy works better than other straight state-of-the-art strategies although the difference is small note that the performance is significantly lower for random on further rounds of al with two best strategies we improve distance classification Auc 2 0.75 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators. We find that PRC has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class. However, the annotators also find the examples difficult. In summary, we find that PRC is a simple A strategy for rare class acquisition and cold-starting ale with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code data set and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you you"}

I'm Akshata and today my co-author Martin and I are presenting our work the Kit Must: Evaluating Knowledge Integration from Multiple Sources. This work is a collaboration between McGill University, Mila and Microsoft Research. National Language Understanding modelsdel draw on a variety of knowledge sources such as knowledge contained in their parameters usually acquired via pre-training and knowledge given in inputs at inference time. Recent works in tasks like question answering show that models can use pre-trained time knowledge to solve the task. But natural language understanding often requires knowledge that is also supplied at inference time, for example, in the sentence \"John saw the newly elected president on TV, pre-trained parameters can contain information about what presidents do and what a TV is, but they cannot reliably know who this instance specific entity John is or who the new president is because the president might have changed since pre-training. Therefore, successful models for knowledgein intensiveive NLU tasks require the ability to integrate and use both pre-trained time and inference time knowledge. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration. We introduce a core-reference resolution task designed to probe for the ability to draw on knowledge available in different sources we evaluate the data set with human study participants and establish corere resolution models here is an example from our data set serving is a judge Kia is a baker Termin and Kia metadata park after a long day at work deciding cases in a law code he was happy to relax. The task here is to identify the correct entity that the pronoun he refers to, which in this case is. The resolution of a given pronoun requires two types of information: first, entity specific knowledge such as servile is a judge, and second, bad knowledge such as judges decide cases in law courts generally background knowledge is learned during the pre traininging of large language models while entity specific knowledge is typically observed at inference time we vary the availability of these two pieces of information such that it may either be found in a single source or in multiple sources We have defined three settings of kitdmos. First we have the typical setting back pre-train where backward knowledge is assumed to be available at freetrain time. Second, there' is the background both setting where backward knowledge is available both at pre-train time and inference time. Lastly, the background inference setting where both knowledge types are available only at inference time this last setting is especially interesting since it simulates the case where the background knowledge necessary to solve a task is not part of the pre-train data of models for example because new occupations have developed since the time of pre-training here's an example of how we control the availability of facts in the two sources in the background pre-train setting we assume that the background knowledge politicians seek elected seats in government is contained in the pre-trained parameters in the interference time context we provide the anti-specific knowledge chichester is a politician in the background both setting we additionally provide not only anti-specific but also background knowledge about politicians in the interference time context in the background inferior setting we provide the feature occupation merely tour instead of politician because merelytour is unlikely to be contained in the pretrained parameters. We evaluate the data set both with human study participants and establish preference resolution models in this figure we show the results of the best performing models on the most difficult variant of the background pretrained setting without task specific training on kitdmos both models do not perform well when trained on kitdmos however both c2f and built for coref perform significantly better than the random choice this suggests that when trained on generic reference resolution data sets models learn to exploit surface cues which are not useful when testing on kitdmus where such cues have been removed additional experiments with fictional knowledge indicate even the best performing models cannot reliably integrate backward knowledge quite only at in free inch time to summarize the main takeaways of our paper many co-reference evolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without taskific training however with taskific training some models successfully integrate knowledge from motorist sources. Still, even the best performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrated backward knowledge presented only at inference time.

What is simultaneous speech translation? Simultaneous speech translation or SimST is the process of translating spoken language into a text in another language in real time enabling cross languageage communication and what are the problems of the current simulaST models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first to use already existing offline SD models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulaSD use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by a model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder decoral attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to a word is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is this sum is below a certain threshold alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is enough stable for example if if we receive a speech chunk containing I'm going to talk about and our model predicts the translation in German and we will look at the cross attention um weights we'll see that the first two words points to the earliest received speech frames while the last word points to the last received pitch frames as lambda speech frames this means that the first two words will be emitted while since the sum of the cross attention is above at certain threshold alpha we will not emit the last word and we wait for another speech chunk if we go on and we receive another speech chunk and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross attention weight we will see that no words points to the last Lambeth lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we look at the main results of a dot we plot the simultaneous speech translation results on on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measure the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware average lacking that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our cures to be as high as possible on this plot but also we want that they are shifted on the left and we compare with plepara strategies that are also applied to offline models that are the Whit key strategy and the local agreement, and we compare also with the state of the art architecture specifically tailored for simultaneous space translation. These are all the results of the simultaneous speech translation strategy on German and we see that uh doubt outperforms all the strategies applied to offline models since the curves are shifted over the left. And we also see that if we consider the actual elapsed time or the computational wear time, AD is the fastest strategy. If you want to discover more results, read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention you"}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 6, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hello everyone. my name is Shu Ha. Today I'm going to present our paper Do Connel 2003 named entityity Tagus still work well in 2023. Let's get started. Our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the NER task we observe that models have been using Con 2003 to develop NER for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new tagger what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we do observe poor generalization what causes the performance drop of these models to investigate these problems we develop the Con plus+ data set this is a data set that we collected from Reuters News from 2020 and then annotated them with the same car 2003 annotation guidelines we then fine-tuned over 20 models on car 2003 we evaluated them on both the Con 3 test set and the con plus fast test set and last but not least we calculated the percentage change in f1 to assess the generalization of each model. So what is needed for good generalization? Through our experiments we found that there are three main ingredients that are needed. The first one is the model architecture. Through our experiments we found that the transformer models normally generalize better to new data. The second ingredient is the model size. We found that usually larger models lead to better generalization and last but not least we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task. Here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization. To our next question, what causes the performance drop of some models? We had two hypotheses. The first one is adaptive overfitting, which is overfitting caused by reusing the same test set over and over again, and this is usually manifested as the diminishion returns on a new test set. The second hypothesis is temporal drift, which is the performance degradation that is caused by the increasing temporal gap between the train and the test data. For adaptive overfitting, we saw that from the graph on the right the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one. This means that every unit of improvement that we made on Con 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on column plus plus, which means that there is no diminishing returns. and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift. Our conclusion is that for good generalization we would need a better model architecture, larger model size as well as more fine-tuning examples and these goes hand in hand we can't just have one ingredients but throughout the others at the same time we also found that the performance drop here is caused by temporal drifts and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive over fitting even though Connell 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do Connal 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes. We hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalizations of the models And lastly please make sure to check out our paper, our dataset and if you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

My name is Regina Stoden and I will guide you through the first part of the presentation. Let's first define text simplification. text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or nonnative speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example of documents or sentences in the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex German sentence and its translation into plain language. To simplify the sentence, different techniques are possible as you can see in the example, such as lexical substitution, clause dilation, cross-eletion reordering, or insertion of words. We now propose our new corpus D plane because in the recent years there were some problems with existing corpora. So for example these corporal here are too small to train a taxonification model on. The other three models which are proposed in recent years are all automatically aligned which means they can be error prone in their alignments. Therefore we propose our new corpus Dplane, which is split into two subcorpora, Deplane APA and Deplane web. Deplane APA is based on use texts. In Deplane APA, we aligned 483 documents all manually. It results in roughly thirty thousand thirteen thousand parallel sentence pairs. For deepplae web, this corpus includes different domains, and we also align all of these seven hundred fifty documents on the one hand manually and on the other hand with automatic alignment methods. In total we result in 30 450 sentence pairs we analyzed our sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification as you can see here the Bible texts are much stronger simplified than for example the news text or the language learner texts on all level regarding for example lexical simplification structured simplification also overall level of simplification furthermore you can see that our deep plaining corpus has a high variety of different simplification transformations so for example in the deeppla API corpus we have much more reorderings and word additions than we have in the deep plane web corpus on the other hand in the web corpus we have much more rephrasings so let's now see what we can do with this corpus hello I am Omar and now I will talk about the use cases for our data set d plane so for the first use case we can evaluate automatic alignment methods. In the recent years there has been a lot of alignment methods but in the context of machine translations, where we have two parallel documents written in different languages and we want to extract alignments of sentences in post documentsments. but in our use case we are trying to extract alignments between sentences of two parallel documents having the same language having the same content but they are on a different complexity levels and now as we have our data set d plane which have manually aligned sentences we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed alignment methods and we did some adaptations to the proposed methods and we have published all these adaptations and the codes to run our experiments in the paper at the end we concluded that the best alignment automatic alignment method to use for texts for German text simplification is the method of mass align and you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper. The second use case that we showed in our paper is a case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified that text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of long part to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base long the normal base part to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we proposed those results as a benchmark a base benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference.

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 8, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hi, I'm X Yuan from FNAi University. I'm here to introduce our work, Distinging Script Knowledge from Light Language Models for constrained languageuage Plan in everyday life, humans must often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of guaranteed scripts. Previous work has exploited language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities, such as make a cake, and show that large language models can effectively decompose goals into steps. However, previous work mainly focuses on planning for the abstract goals of stereotypical activities planning for the goals with specific goals specific constraints such as make a chocolate cake still remains understatted in this paper we define the problem of constrained language planning which impose different constraints on the goals of planning an abstract goal can be inherited by different real life specific goals with multi-face constraints a good planner should write scripts that are reasonable and faithful to constraints in this paper we first evaluate and improve the constrained language planningability of life language models since no data side of specific goals exists to spot our study we have to acquire these goals first as shown in the table we extend the abstract goals with multi-faceed constraints for human in the loop data acquisition use instruct GPT we sample 100 specific goals and evaluate the scripts generated from library models this table reports the overall accuracy of the results. We find that all learning models achieve unsatisfactory results on planning for specific goals. Then we conduct detailed analysis to investigate what learning models for. Results in the figure show that the semantic completeness in generated scripts is acceptable, but the faithfulness to the constraints cannot be guaranteed. We dig into more fine-gradd topic categories of constraints defined in WiH. The heat map in the figure shows that the planning performance of instruct GPDs varies considerably for girls of different categories, previous studies have shown that the output quality of learning models falls in high variance, leading to bad performance. Thus, we adopt the idea of overgenerated Z filter to improve generation quality. We first show constrained types with examples for instruct CPT and obtain specific goals based on the seed abstract goals then instruct GPT over generatetes key scripts for specific goals next a filter model is developed to select the faithful scripts we convert scripts and goals into instruct GPT embeddings and calculate cosine similarity and similarity scores to measure semantic similarity. In addition, we award the script that contains the keywords of the target constraint. We only keep the script if the target goal scores the highest in the goal size. With our method instructGbt can generate scripts of higher quality. Our method greatly improves the planability both in semantics, completeness and faithfulness to the constraint. Since large language models are costly to deploy, it is essential to enable language planability of smaller and specialized models. creating dataset is an essential step to its end. However, previous studies do not enable planning for specific goals and manual manual data dataset annotation is expensive. this we follow the idea of symbolic knowledge distillation to distill constrained language planning dataset from light language models. We apply our method for building a dataset of constrained language planning named as CodeScript. In total, we generate 55,000 specific goals with scripts. To ensure the quality of validation and test sites, we ask crowd-sourced workers to find revise the income in incorrect samples this figure shows the consstraint distribution of codescript we find codescript shows the high pluralism in the generated specific goals with codescript we can treat smaller but specialized models for constrained language planning we find that t5 fine-tuned on score rate can generate scripts of hair qualities than most large language models indicating that smaller models can support large larger models when properly trained on suitable data sites in summary we established the constrained language planning problem we evaluate constrained language planning ability of large language models and develop a overgenera filter method for live language models we use a large language models to generate a high quality square data set codescript for constrained language planning we hope code data set can be a valuable resource to advance the research on language planning. Thanks for your time. Please find more details of CodeScript in our paper"}

We introduce the first biomedical model in French named Dr. Bert which is based on Roberta and train on nachtchos which is a data set of medical crawled data from the web. We also introduce a comparison of model with multiple cryonic settings and data sources. Then we present our result on 11 biomedical and clinical downstream tasks in French and finally we conclude about the experiments and give you more details about how to access to the models since this its release in 2018 Bert has become one of the most effective approach to solve natural language processing tasks and offer huge performance gain compared to historical static and contextualized methods such as war to ve fast text or and more since then this this model has been adapted to many other languages like in French with camembert and other domain like biomedical with permit birth and bio birth and on clinical with clinical birth but mostly in English specialized model for other languages are scarce and are often based on continual pretraining due to the lack of in-domain data however French didn nott have any open source model for biomedical until now we so we ask ourselves question about what is the most appropriate data sources for a wide range of usage and those crude data are good substitution for clinical data to answer this question we compare dr Bert with our schubert model which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital at our house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on French data is it four gigabyte 8 gigabyte or more to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch model a first version of drbert with seven gigabyte of nachos a second version of four gigabytes of set of natureos a first version of schubert which is a clinical model with four gigabytes of sentences taken from clinical notes and a final version of schubert with a mix of four gigabytes of set of natures and four gigabytes of clinical node in addition to this comparison we introduced three models trained on control pre-training to analyze the impact of pre-training strategy one based on the weight of camembert and train on four gigabytes of set of nature another also based on camembert but trained this time on the four gigabyte of clinical lots and finally one base of on English biomedical model bermedbert and train on four gigabytes of set of snatches in total we have seven models to evaluate our seven models we gather which public and private downstream tasks such as nameander recognition classification part of speech tagging and question answering this models are compared to six baseline models which are camembert oscar one hundred thirty eight gigabyte camembert oscar four gigabyte camembert cc net four gigabyte plummet bird biobert and clinical bird the evolution of highlight that model perform best on the task with data of the same nature as those on which the model has been trained however we we can obtain that data from we can observe that data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile. we also observe that using more data translates into better performance. In overall, from scratch free training seem to obtain higher performance on most of the task. However, our experiment on consumer pre traininging using the weight and tokenizer of permit bird trained on the four gigabyte subset of naturalos show comparable result to those obtained with dr. Bert 4 gigabyte from scratch which is not the case for the model based on camembert weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues finally as a conclusion our proper system offer better performance on nine of the 11 dontstream tasks and surpass globally the result of the generic model here camembert. we also observe that specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well. all the pre-trained model obtained from Nachos are freely available and on you interface and all the training script are on our github repository so thank you for for this presentation and we are looking forward to actions at the poster session in Toronto you"}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 10, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "- Hi, I'm Xhang Bing, PhD student in the University of Washington. Today I'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair NLP models. So language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data. Political news media are well covered in their pre-training data. According to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new York Times Los Angeleses Times the Guardian Huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and a plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream task applications to this end we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks specifically by asking the following questions first how do we evaluate the political leaning of language models and what role does cruing data might have on such political biases? secondly, how do language models with different political leaning actually perform on downstream tasks and whether that might result in fairness issues in nlp applications so specifically we first propose to prompt language models with different prompt formats using the political questionnaires such as the political compass test this ensures us to do automatic evaluation well grounded in political science literature so some preliminary results demonstrate that first language models do have varying political leanings they occupy all four quadrants on the political compass we can also see that gpt4 is the most liberal language model of them all and gpt series are generally more socially liberal than bird series and its variants secondly we aim to investigate to which to which extent the political biases of language models are actually picked up from training data so we could conduct a controlled experiment by further pre-training language model checkpoints on six different partisan corpora separated into news and social media further divided into their political leaning by further pre-training language models on such partisan corpora we can see that the ideological coordinates of the language model also correspondingly shift for example for roberta further fine-tuned further trained on the left-leaning reddit corpus we can see a substantial liberal shift in terms of its in terms of its political biases and we also try to investigate whether language models can pick up the polarization that's prevalent in our modern society so we divide pre-training corpora into pre-45th president of the united states and after 45th president of the united states we separately pre-train language models onto the two different temporal corpora we can see that language models generally had a political leaning that is further away from the center after 2017 so this indicates that language models can also pick up the like polarization in our society so last but not least we evaluate language models with different political leanings on hate speech detection and fake news detection to nlp applications that often involve language models and could have very significant implications so we see that if we investigate the per category performance that is to say if we separate the performance into different demographics or political medium news media we can see a pattern that for example for hate speech detection left-ling language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups however are worse at detecting hate speech targeting more power for groups in our society and vice versa right-ling language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting white and men however worse at detecting hate speech targeting at black lgbtq plus and other minority communities similar trends also happen for fake news detection where we see that left-ling language models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political leaning and vice versa this in we further show many qualitative examples to see that language models with different political meanings do give different predictions to hate speech and misinformation examples based on their social categories there are a bunch of more examples in the appendix to further highlight that this indicates that there is a fairness issue that is very pressing regarding the political biases of language models for example if a right-wingning language models were to be fine-tuned on hate speech or misinformation or whatever and deploy to a popular social media platform this would mean that people with opposite political opinions might be marginalized and the hate speech targeting minority groups might just run rampant without any control. So this has sounds the alarm for us to acknowledge and tackle the fairness issues resulted by language model political leanings. So a little bit of discussion. We would also like to highlight that we expose the unique dilemma regarding language model political biases it's like between sycyilla and charybdis so if we do not sanitize political opinions in language model training data the bias would propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language monotaining data so it's kind of like the electroly electric trolie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today five for today thank you for your time you"}

Language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context. This is a joint work with John Waqui, Aaron Mueller, Kanishka Mishra, Karen Fs, Roger Levy, and Atina Williams. So in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm. So the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gym or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as crowds pairs. and in this minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like a acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence the current MPP pipeline basically doesn't allow us to evaluate models acceptance towards longer sentences these days large language models are coming up with longer and longer context windows so it's crucial that we evaluate the models' acceptability on throughout the context window and that is what we are trying to do here we are trying to revisit the MPV pipeline by asking the model to evaluate acceptability on longer and longer sequences so that is the approach so what we do is that to simulate these longer sequences we revisit the data sets themselves and then we recreate sentences by choosing uh like acceptable or unacceptable sentences from those data sets so for example here we have chosen like a typical pair of grammatical tea from the blim data set from the adjunct Island case and what we do is that to recreate like longer sequences and which are acceptable and which has the same matching of the grammatical structure we extract grammatical sentences from adjunct island and then we add it as a prefix to both the acceptable query and the unacceptable query so we can do the same thing by choosing unacceptable sentences from the same matching and that could also like be used to test the models acceptability and we can also do the same by choosing sentences from a different subset or a different data set so that is what we call as the mismatch scenario so here the sentences are still coming from relevant data sets but it's not from the same data set that you are evaluating with and we can do the same for unacceptability case finally we can choose sentences from a completely unrelated domain such as wikipedia so this will tell us like whether the models acceptability judgments are actually impacted by any context like whether the context is coming from a different uh subset of the data set or whether it's like completely irrelevant to the current uh like to the sentence that we are looking at so how does the model do so first we look at the Wikipedia sentences, which are completely irrelevant to the current query pair, and there we find that the MPP judgments are mostly robust for arbitrary context length. We increase the context length toward up to thousand and twenty four for to max out Ot and gpt two models, and we saw here in the orange dotted line the MPP judgments are relatively stable now what happens when we choose sentences from the same data set so here we are choosing or creating sentences from acceptable and unacceptable domains from the same blim syntax gym data set and there we see that the MPP judgments either increase or decrease significantly when you add either acceptable prefixes or unacceptable prefixes but when we match the structure that is when we choose the sentences from the same phenomena in blame person syntax gym we see a massive increase or a massive decrease in of the pp judgment for the model depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change it course in terms of how it shows us the MPP judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturb sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable approval domain we see decrease in MPP judgments similar fashion. So the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences. and the MPP evaluation, the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input, may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window.

In this video I would like to present our recent work, Weaker than you think, a critical look at weeklyvis learning. This is joint work with X, Myos Mosbach and Ge Steffen and Dirich Klako. I'd like to begin with a brief introduction to weak supervision and weakly supervised learning. In weak supervision we do not manually label the data. instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules, knowledge base or low quality crowd sourcing, as illustrated in the figure on right. When compared to human annotations the weaker annoations are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weekly label data the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize in weekly supervised learning training algorithms are proposed to robustly train neural networks under such label noise so that the trained models still generalize well in recent works in wSL so wSL stands for weeklyvised learning a common claim is that people say that the only train models on the weekly label data and achieve high performance on clean test sets technically this claim is not wrong but there's a catch which is that people do assume that there is an additional clean validation set a wellwol for model selection we cast stopped on this problem setting but this implies that additional manual annotations are required in weekly support learning but like an elephant in the room this necessity is often overlooked the aforementioned adopt is asked to ask three research questions first is clean validation data necessary for wSL or can we maybe use a anno validation set instead? Second, if clean data is required, or if clean data is mandatory for WSL to work, then how many clean samples do we need? Finally, should we only use the clean samples for validation, or there are better ways to utilize them. We addressed these research questions in our work and our findings are as follows: first we find that interestingly recent WSL methods indeed require clean validation samples to work properly otherwise there is a large performance drop as shown this figure if there are no clean validation samples then the trend models cannot generalize beyond the original weak labels meaning that the training is pointless this indicates that wsSL approaches actually require cleanly labeled data to work properly and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help WSL approaches to achieve better performance, as shown in the figure on the left. Typically, we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance. But that's not the end of the story, because if we either way decide to access clean samples, then training on them directly will even achieve better performance. The red figure shows the performance difference between fine-tuning approaches, which are directly applied under clean data, and WSL approaches, which use the clean data for validation only. As we can see, if we have ten samples per class, direct fine-tuning starts to beat WSL approaches. Finally, the performance improvement claimed in previous WSL approaches can be easily achieved by allowing to continue fine-tuning on clean validation samples. As we can see from the figures, the valida model termed FTW initially underperforms more complicated WSL methods like cosine. However, if we allow to continue Fantuning under clean samples, then FTW performs equally well as other methods. So in practice there's no reason to choose more complex WSL methods which require more computation time and the disk space to summarize we showed that recent wSL approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done well clean validation samples second WSL approaches should be compared with few short landing baselines as suppose work on concrete samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in WSL. Finally, we have open source our code. you can find it via the QR code on this slide. Please feel free to check it out. Thank you and enjoy the conference"}

This is joint work with my colleagues from Google Translate. Pm is a 540 billion parameters language language model presented last year in 2022. It's trained on a large collection of texts comprising 780 billion tokens at the time of publication it achieves state of the art in hundreds of nlp tasks in this work we present a free systematic study of large language model prompting for machine translation we evaluate the translation capacity of such models using the best practices of the imt community this involves using the latest test sets to avoid an overlap of the test data with the training data of the language model and we compare two state-of-the-art systems so the best performing systems of the wmt evaluation we use state-of-the-art neuralmt metrics and additionally also show expert-based human evaluation results finally we provide some recommendations for prompt selection strategies the prompting has a big influence on the performance of the of llms for translation as we can see in a simple experiment where we use one short prompting and provided two different prompts for different sentence. The majority of sentences and 516 out of 1000, the difference observed is of more than one blurred points. And this can go in extreme cases up to 40 blurred points. So it's important to select a good prompting strategy in our experiments we settled for a five-shot prompting strategy where we just mark its its sentence that we provide the to the system with the language it's in so in this example here where we perform translation from german into english the german sentences the source sentences are marked with german colon and the English translations with English column we saw that the actual form of the printing doesn't have a big influence in in the case of several short prompting it's crucial for zero and one shot prompting but when we go as in our case to fact short prompting there is nearly no difference to the actual form of the of the prompting it's the examples that carry most of the of the weight the summary of our experimental results is that the example quality is more important than the similarity similarity to the source sentence so it's important to select the examples from high quality translations in particular we compare the selecting prompts from the train data of the wmt evaluations or the dev data the dev data is much more created and with higher quality that the train data that it's more nice and the results show a better performance when using the the dev data nevertheless specialized state-of-the-art systems have a substantial advantage over the palm translations but palm comes pretty close to a commercial system now in our case we chose to evaluatete with Google Translate the insights that we gained from the emailation that we perform using the NpN framework is that the fluency of palm is comparable to state of the of the art systems, but the main difference comes from the accuracy. So in particular, the most common errors are omission errors. So it seems that Palm chooses to produce a better sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are are made in the in translation however the style outward category for pan is lower than for the state-of-the-art systems which is an additional signal that par provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy and that's it for this really short overview for more details please come my to the full presentation of the paper thank you very much you"}

It's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video of our paper. Are you copying my model, Protecting the copyright of large Lang models for embedding and services? Vi back the watermark. Let's first introduce the background about embedding ad services. Currently, large language models such as Gbt, La,  PLm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation. Embedding ad services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various NLP tasks. for example, OpenI offers a gbt based embedding API however resent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding and provide similar services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding services one of the solutions to embed a watermark in the provider service and detect whether another service contain the watermark the watermark method need to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding third the watermark should be convert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark need to be transferable to the attacker services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these method either not applicable to embedding as services or lack of transferability therefore in this paper we propose embedding marker which is a backdoor based watermark method applicable to embedding as services then let me introduce the details of our embedding marker embedding marker contains two main steps watermark injection and copyright verification before these main steps we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it in watermark injection we first define a target embedding when a user send a sentence to the provider service the provider counts the trigger number in the sentence the provided embedding is a weight summation of the target embedding and the original embedding. The weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence. When the number of triggers in the sentence is greater than m, the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding. Copyright verification is to detect whether or model behind another service contains the watermark. We first construct a backdoor and a benign data set. Backdoor dataset contains sentences of which all words belong to the trigger set while all words in the sentences of benign dataset do not belong to the trigger set. Then the provider requests embeddings from the stiller service with the data set the cosine and l2 similarity between the requested embedding and the target embedding are computed we compute the similarity difference between benig and backdoor data set which is defined as Delta cosine and delta l2 meanwhile we also apply KS test and use its p-value as the third metric we conduct experiments on four data set Aaging news mind SD2 and A spam we assume the provider apply wiki text data set to count word frequency the results on four data sets show that our embedding marker can have great detection performance while keep great utility for downstream tasks. We also validate the converttness of the provided embedding by visualizing the embedding of sentences on four dataset B PCA. The legend of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence, as shown in the figures. It's hard to distinguish between the factor embeddings and normal embeddings. That's all. Thank you. We'll come to discuss with us"}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 15, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hello everyone. my name is Ian and my colleague Jiian and I will be presenting our research on multi-instrucct improving multimodal serial learning via instruction tuning. So with the advances in large language models, many works started to explore new learning paradigms of using protrain language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data-fficient way. Recently, many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen tasks in a serialshot manner by following natural instructions. However, most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the serialshot performance on language-only tasks, where computer vision and multimodal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multimodal protein models can actually improve generalization to unseen multimodal tasks additionally at the time of our research we discovered a considerable discrepancy in availability of instruction data set between P and multimodal there exists more than 1 and 600 lunch-only instruction tasks however there is no largescale publicly available multimodal instruction task therefore this motivate us to build a multimodal instruction tuning data set here we present multi-ins instructct the first multimodal instruction tuning benchmark data set that consists of 62 diverse multimodal tasks covering 10 board categories these tasks are derived from 21 existing open source data set and each task is equipped with five expert written instructions for investigating multimodal instruction tuning on our proposed data set we take offa a unified multi-modal training model as our base model ofFA use a unified vocabulary for language image tokens and the coordinate of a bounding box here we show some example instances from our multi-instra data set to unify the processing of a various input and output data type we follow the method from offa and formulate all the tasks in a unified sequence to sequence format in which the input text images instruction and bounding boxes are represented in the same token space okay now I'm gonna talk about multimodal instruction tuning. So for the training dataset, we use fifty three tasks from N group for training and we sample ten thousand instance per task for testing. We reserve the entire common sense reading group for testing and we select additional five tasks from Wiki and the miscellaneous group. We use all the instances in the test speed for each task, in addition, we randomly sample 20 tasks from the test speed of natural instruction as on same task for NP so we use a pre-train of a large model as a base model during training we mix all the instance for all the tasks each instance is randomly combined with one of its five instruction templates so during test for each task we conduct the total of five experiments by evaluating the model using one of the five instructions in each experiment we report the mean and max performance and the standard deviation of the performance across all five experiments if the task is a multimodal classification task we report accuracy if it's a multimodal generation task we report root l for an LP task we report root l as well we also introduced a additional evaluation metric called sensitivity so this measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task regardless of the slight variation in the wording of the instruction, here is our main result. as we can see, instruction tuning can significantly improve  ofF's performance on same multimodal tasks. Also transfer learning from natural instruction dataset can benefit instruction tuning. Here we can see as the amount of task increase the model achieve better performance and in the meantime lower sensitivity so we also did one experiment we use one instruction versus five instruction as we can see using more instruction can improve the model's overall performance and reduce its sensitivity a lot so this shows the effect of different fun-tuning strategy on the model sensitivity as we can see by transfer learning from natural instruction data sets the model can achieve much better sensitivity compared to the original IFA model we also can see transfer learning from natural instruction data set can help OFA to achieve much better performance on the nitrogen instruct data set so overall we are proposed the first large-scale multimodal instruction tuning data set we significantly improve the neural capability of ofFA and we explore different transfer learning technique and show there are benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity. So one more thing we are collecting a much larger multimodal instruction tuning data sets with around 150 additional variant language tasks and we will release them so this is a QR code for our data and model.

Today I'm going to present our work, Ex examplelar: Cross-lingual Semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and manual representations. So semantic parsing is a task to build semantic representations of user queries such as SQL and Lambda calculus. And cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to SQL lambda or funql and etc existing cross-lingual semantic parsing models are separately proposed and evaluated on data set of limited tosses and applications for instance there are leaks of coverage on certain natural language the Chinese is missing and there are leaks of coverage on certain mini representations the Lambda calculus is missing or they arere only evaluated on certain neural model for example there's only one single model to evaluate them so to this end we propose exampler but provide a uniform data set exampler for cross-lingual semi-persing in multiple natural languages and meaning representations it contains nine data sets in virus domains five semi paring taxes, 8 million representations and 22 natural languages in 15 language families. And to better evaluate our benchmark we consider the six settings for training and evaluation. The first one is translate test. We use Google Translate API to translate source to the target language then use monolingual model to train an evaluation. And for example, we train the English model on English query and during inference we translate the German query using API to English and then use the trained model to predict the SQL. And we also test monolingual model. In this setting the source language is the same as target language, for example German to German or English to English we also test monolingual fusion setting by training monolingual models with only 10 percent of training data and we test modeling multilingual model which we train one multilingual model for all languages for example uh we put the German English Chinese queries together to train a multilingual model and during inference we can use this model to to translate German queries or Chinese query or etc and we also consider cross-lingual zero short and field short transfer we train on one source language and transfer to another language so during training we train it on English query or the combination of English and German Fu short queries to train a multilingual model and predict the seQL output and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyze of monolingual models, we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder PDR which stands for multilingual pertrained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as XLr plus PDdR and bird plus PDdR and we also evaluate encoder decoder models, which is multilingual pertrain encoder decoder models, such as MBt and Mt5. We found that encoder decoder obtains the best performance on all nine data sets. And we evaluate on MT5 and XLMR plus PDR a multilingual setting. We found that encoder decoder or encoder PDR can be improved by training in a mixture of various languages. And we found it is because most of the major natural languages can obtain performance gain, except that English performance drops in seven data sets and only gains in three data sets. I think this is known as curves of multilinguality. We also compared the cross-lingual performance gap. In this figure, the blue line is cross-lingual few short transfer. the orange line is cross-lingual zeroshot transfer while the green line is in the monolingual setting. We found that by comparing the green and orange line, we found the zero short setting, the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that with few short setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example encoder decoder outperforms progress work or achieved comparable results training our English natural language can significantly boost the performance of few short on target natural languages and we found multilingual language models such as coders and blue are still indequate for cross-lingual semantic parsing classes to sum up we built exampler a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and mean representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multilingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc. And welcome to visit our paper and code.

As you may know, there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches. so for example, in the universal dependencies, the structure of the coordination Lisa, Bart and Maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure so in this case lisa a similar approach is assumed in igor milchuk's meaning text theory where again the whole coordinate structure is headed by the first conjunct so these two approaches are asymmetric right they they single out one of the conjuncts now they are also symmetric approaches to coordinate structures such as the prag approach the conjunction headed approach assumed in prag dependency tree banks where coordinate structures are headed by the conjunction so we get dependencies from end to all the conjuncts and finally there's also a multi-headed approach that's used for example in the cutson's word grammar where so to say all conjuncts are heads of the coordinate structure so we get dependencies from the governor here loves to all conjuncts separately these are buttons making now the aim of this paper is to produce a novel argument for the symmetric structures of coordination like these two and against the asymmetric structures of coordination like these two okay the argument is based on the principle of dependency length minimization that I will explain on the basis of these examples so in English as you might as you might know our direct objects prefer to be close to the verb while adjuncts may be further away right so March read it yesterday is fine because the direct object it is close to the verb while March read yesterday it is much worse right because here between the verb and the direct object there is an adjunct yesterday however this effect may be ameliorated when when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine march read this absolutely fascinating book about the bc yesterday is okay in the way instead of it we have this long and p but it's also okay to say march read yesterday this absolutely fascinating book about bees so the reasoning here is that uh this is possible because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that direct objects should be next to the verb it satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization which says that shorter shorter dependencies are preferred so um these two trees only show uh the length of the crucial dependencies so the ones that are not constant among these two structures so here we have the dependency from red to the adjunct of length seven measured in words and from red to book of length four so together it's 11. when you move when you swap these two constituents the sum of these two dependencies becomes six right so instead of 11 six much shorter that's why this sounds quite okay right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of pen of the pentry bank and see the paper why we didn't use university dependencies and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter uh so salt and pepper not pepper and salt measured in syllables and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length the length difference so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts uh grows uh the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is is bigger of the left uh short conjuncts but what's novel uh in in this paper is uh we that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left are absent right so the governor is on the left in this example i saw bar and lisa so iss the governor is on the left uh it's absent in the second example homer came and sneezed here we have coordination of two verbs and there's no outside external governor right so in such cases the left conjunct prefers to be shorter the more so the the bigger the difference between the two conjuncts however when the govern is on the right as here left governs the coordination tail and net uh this effect disappears so we show that by measuring length in characters there's the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show in the paper how this provides an argument against us asymmetric structures of coordination as these two andfold the symmetric structures as these two. So see the paper for the full agreement and arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session. Thank you"}

This work was done in collaboration with Patrick Ferange, Emiliu, Andre F.D Martins, and Graham Newbiig. So a lot of translations depend on context. For example, how would we translate mole in this sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then more refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can translate cases like this is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context which makes corpus level metrics like blue unable to capture these translations and some people have suggested targeted evaluation on context dependent translations but these resources only support limited types of contextpend translations and limited sets of languages, since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation. In this work, we try to answer these two questions. First, when does translation require context? and second, how well do models handle these cases? To answer the first question, we started by measuring how much a work depends on context in translation in the previous work we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context C provides about the target y given the source x you can think of cxmi as the information gained from giving context to the model in this work we extend cxmi to point y cxmi which can measure context usage at the sentence level or at the word level we can think of words that have high p6mi as ones that require context for translation now we analyze words with high p6mi to look for patterns between these words and we perform our analysis on transcripts ofted talks that have been translated from English to 14 different languages we perform our analysis at three different levels first we look at part of speech tags that have high means pxmi and this allows us to find for example dual pronouns in Arabicic that have relatively high pxMmi and this can be explained because English doesn't have dual pronouns so you need context to determine if a pronoun is dual when translating into Arabic and similarly we find that certain languages also require context when we want to choose the appropriate verb form we then look at vocabulary items that have high p6I averaged over all of its different occurrences and this helps us identify cases like the one here where in Chinese you need context to translate proper nouns to make sure that you're using the same translation within the document and similarly we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality and finally we look at different individual tokens that have high pxmi and this allows us to identify phenomena that cannot really be captured by the word itself but that's rather expressed in the sentence structure such as ellipsis resolution so now we use our findings from our analysis to design a benchmark for document level translation for each of the five discourse phenomena we identified we created taggers to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse aware or muda tagger we can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena we then use the muda tagger by applying the tagger on a parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation and we apply our translation metrics of choice on the context dependent examples that the M tagger has identified. And finally we use our benchmark as well as other metrics to evaluate different models on the document level machine translation. First of all, when we use corpus level metrics, so for blue we find that context agnostic models have the best performance. but then if we use commentt, context aware models perform best. And if we use wordf measure, then models with or without context have comparable performance. This again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best document level translation system if we use corpus level metrics alone now we use the M benchmark to evaluate models and we find that context aware models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context for certain discourse phenomena such as formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document level translation we also compared different commercial systems and our benchmark shows that dL is usually more accurate than Google Trans for document level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our refines to build a benchmark for document level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomenal models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document level translation Thank you so much for your attention see you in Toronto you"}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 19, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hi everyone, I'm Jenny, a first-year PhD student at Carnegie Mel University, and today I'll be presenting your work AnL positionality, characterizing design biases and beta sets of models. This work was done in collaboration with some folks at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI, namely Sebastian Santi, Ronin Labrasse, Katharina Reinika, and Martin Sapp. So let's start off by imagining that you're working for a newspaper and you're sifting through comments under your news article trying to remove toxic content you might turn towards a popular API like prospective API for toxicity detection and this works really well if you're Carl Jones where prospective API is able to detect correctly toxic instances but that's not really the case for didtha Sharma where perspectiveive API is really not as sensitive to offensive terms that are more common in Indian contexts this is an example of a design bias where we see systematic performance differences of technology between populations design biases like the one that we just saw before might occur due to the positionality of the NLP researchers and model developers. Positionality is simply the perspectives that people hold as a result of their demographics, identity, and life experiences. This is a concept widely used in critical studies, specifically in feminist and queer academic spaces. And as a researcher, positionality can influence the research process and its outcomes and results because it can change the decisions that researchers make and so one question that people might ask is do data sets and models have positionality and we're not trying to say that models themselves and data sets themselves have demographic identities and life experiences but they do aggregate judgments and opinions of real people and can thus represent certain positionalities over others so prior work has suggested some anecdotal evidence of having positionality such as cultural gaps in models and data sets as well as theoretical definitions of model positionality however these works really don't look at comparing end users with the data sets and models themselves and studying model and data set positionality is increasingly important as NLP tasks become more subjective and socially oriented and it's challenging to characterize how these positionalities are skewed because not all decisions are documented and many models are hidden behind apis so to study data set and model positionality we actually compare the annotations with real users with existing data sets and models we do this through our framework Nl positionality our framework works in two main steps the first step is to re-annotate data sets with diverse annotators and we opt to do this over looking at the demographics of original data sets annotators because usually only a few annotators annotate each instance and because demographics are rarely collected and shared and so we opt to re-annotate data to get many annotates for instance and to get a rich set of demographic data we then take the annotations by demographic and compare them to the models and data sets using Pearson's our correlation score and thus our framework actually differs from annotator disagreement literature by comparing end users with models and data sets predictions and labels as opposed to looking at just entered annotator agreement or modeling annotator distributions our framework is largely enabled through lab in the wild an online crowdsourcing platform former HCI collaborator and lab in the wild is an online experimentation platform where we can recruit diverse volunteers compared to the platforms like  Turk which largely have participants from the US or India and further lab in the wild still is able to get high quality data we host two tasks on lab in the wild one of them being social acceptability and the way this works is that participants will read a situation from the social chemistry data set and then they'll write how socially acceptable a situation is afterwards to stay engaged in the study they can compare their responses to an AI and others we then compared these annotations with social chemistry Delphi and gPT4. We then replicated a very similar setup for the toxicity and hate speech detection task where they'll read an instance from Dynah Hate and write whether they think it's instance of hate speech. We then compared these annotations with Dyna Hate Perspective API,  Rewire API, Hate Roberta and GPT4. Our study and the end amassed over 16,00 annotations from over a thousand annotators from eighty seven countries. so now we 're better equipped to answer who do NLP dataset and models align with the most? We find that there is positionality in NLP. for example, we find that dataset and models are most aligned to Englishspe countries. so for the gpd four social acceptability analysis we find that it's most aligned to Confucian and english-speaking countries we find that Dinah hate is also most aligned to english-speaking countries we also find most additional alignment with people who have a college education so for gpd4 in the social acceptability task we find that it's most aligned to people with a college education or graduate school education and we find the same for Danny hate where it's most aligned to people with the college education however when models and data sets are aligned to specific populations some are inevitably left behind an example of this is that data sets and models are less aligned to non-binary people compared to the men and women counterparts we find this in the gPDd4 social acceptability task as well as the dina hate task analysis as well so given that there is physician anality in NP what can we do about it so we have a few recommendations for this first one is keep a record of all relevant design choices throughout the research process and the other is to do NLP research with the lens of prospectivism our third recommendation is to build specialized data sets and models within four specific communities and a good example of this is the masakanne initiative I and we want to emphasize that inclusive NLP isn't just making you know all technologies work for everyone and so that concludes our presentation but if you'd like to learn more feel free to check out our dashboard for the most updated analysis results and our paper thank you you"}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 20, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hi and I'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect differential expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entity corpus and my name is Javad Hosseini and this is a joint work with Philip Radlinsky, Sylvia Parity and Annie Luis. Our goal is to understand users language when they want to make a choice. And I consider this alternative question: Did you mean \"easy on me\" or \"I got a feeling?\" Here a user wants to select between one of these two songs. The most obvious thing is to use a direct reference, for example by saying the name of the song \"Easy on Me\" or its position, the first one but sometimes an indirect reference is more appropriate to have a more natural conversation this could happen when the user cannot remember the name of the song or the pronunciations are too similar to each other and hard to disambiguate or when the user wants to specify a preference. Here are some examples in indirect differences. for example the newer one or the sign that's not energetic. This is an important problem in conversational systems and also for benchmarking LLM's entity understanding. We're not aware of a public data set, a larger scale public data set for a task so we collect one using crowd annotation our data set covers three different domains music books and recipes our data set collection methodology emphasizes informality using a cartoon completion setup the cartoon has three speech bubbles in the first bubble Bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that Bob sets the dialogue context in this in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or I got our feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble Bob uses an indirect reference to select one of these entities for example the newer one we provide the first and second speech bubbles automatically but the third one is filled in by the annotator the first speech bubble is chosen from a few manual prompts per domain the second one which is the alternative question is generated as follows we always use a simple template do you mean a or b where a and b are samples from wikipedia Here are the different sampling methods we've used. When we move higher in the list, the entities become more similar to each other and it's usually harder to make the disambiguation. The first one is uniform at random. The second one is when the entities have similar titles for example two books with the name they return. The third one is when they have similar descriptions on wikipedia and finally when they have similar info boxes or attributes on wikipedia for example the same genre or the same artist for song when we show this alternative question to the am statustors they know the name of these entities but they don't necessarily know about the entities so what we do is that we show some background knowledge about the two entities for songs we simply show a Google search link to each song and then ask the annotators to listen to at least some of each song and read about each song here's for example the google search result for the song easy on me for the recipes and books domain we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from Wikipedia so that the annotators know how they look like then we ask the annotators to pick one of these entities for example here the first one and describe them using three to five indirect referring expressions for example the one with the piano music here are some examples from our data set for example the one without words not the one with the 12 year 12 year old boy or the fictional one or comes from Azerbaijan and so on the alternative corpus has 6 000 alternative questions across three domains and it has 422,000 indirect referring expressions results with t5x large model are summarized below if the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators then the accuracy is really high it's around 92 to 95 percent but this is not realistic if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge, then the accuracy is between 82 to 877%, which is more realistic. for example, when the language model retrieves the background knowledge. If the language model has access only to entity names, then the accuracy is only 6 percent, so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our data set thanks for"}
