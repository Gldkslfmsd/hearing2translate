{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 0, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hi, my name is Matthias Lindemann and today I'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multi-set tagging and latent permutations. This is joint work with my advisors Alexander Koller and Ivan Titov. Compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of Compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training. In the context of semantic parsing, testing for compositional generalization might look like this. As usual, we have a training set of utterances, in this case the girl slept and Mary knew that the girl slept. These utterances are paired with logical forms that represent core aspects of their meaning. In contrast to standard machine learning evaluation, the test set does not come from the same distribution but contains structurally unseen logical forms. In this example, the model has seen shallower recursion during training, and is tested on an example with deeper recursion. Naive sequence-to-sequence models struggle with this kind of out-of-distribution generalization and often produce outputs that are detached from the input. In particular, they often fail to reproduce the systematic correspondences between input and output, such as those that are color-coded in the example. A popular method to address this is to integrate trees into the models. The trees are intended to capture the compositional process that relates utterances with the logical forms. is to integrate trees into the models. The trees are intended to capture the compositional process that relates utterances with the logical forms. This works well, but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow. This can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process. Typically, this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms, for example, to handle variable symbols. Obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures. In this paper, we don't use trees, and introduce a neural sequence-to-sequence model that directly models the correspondences between fragments of the input and fragments of the output. For the first time we show strong generalization to deeper recursion without relying on trees. Our approach predicts the output from the input in two steps. First, we tag each input token with an unordered multiset of tokens that will appear in the output. After the first step, we have all the right tokens but they are not ordered. That's why in the second step, we use another model to predict a permutation to put them into the right order. We introduce a new method to predict a permutation that does not put any hard constraints on the possible permutations. This makes our approach quite flexible and expressive. Conceptually, our permutation model works roughly like this. We go from left to right over the output and determine which multi-set token to put in every position. For the first output position, we simply select one as highlighted in red. Then, we jump to the next multiset token to determine the second token in the output. We similar way by jumping to another multiset token. We continue this process until every token from the first stage has been visited exactly once. To give you a teaser of the experimental results, here we compare our method with other tree-less models on the COGS benchmark. Our model outperforms the others by a large margin on generalization to deeper recursion. Some other kinds of structural generalization remain very challenging though. In our paper, we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges. First of all, the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data. As a consequence, for a given token, we don't know which multiceller it came from, which poses a challenge for training. In addition, sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data, but the linguistically correct one is latent. We address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training. Our permutation method is very flexible, but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is NP-hard. That's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem. We approximate this with a GPU-friendly, continuous relaxation that also allows us to backpropagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations. If you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges, please have a look at our paper or come to our poster."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 1, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hi, I'm Myra, and today I'll be talking about our paper Marked Personas, Using Natural Language Prompts to Measure Stereotypes in Language Models. This work is done in collaboration with Esen Dermusch and Dan Jorofsky. In recent years, many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models, or LLMs. However, these measures have various limitations. They usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate, and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes, meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts, or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups. Furthermore, most work in this space doesn't account for intersectionality, which is the notion that multifaceted social identities can compound biases and be unique loci of harm. To overcome these limitations, we rely on the property that these newer instruction-tuned LLMs are very good at responding to instructions in prompts. So we can ask the model to generate a persona, which is a depiction of an imagined individual using a prompt like, imagine you are an Asian woman, describe yourself. And we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic, because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want into this prompt. So here are some example generations from GPT-4. Immediately, we see that while the outputs aren't overtly negative or toxic in the traditional sense of these words, there are some interesting patterns. The Asian woman is depicted as unassuming. The Middle Eastern woman is referred to using words like exotic and like referring to a mesmerizing region. And both of the women of color personas make references to ancestry, while the white man persona has nothing of the sort. To capture these patterns, our method has two parts. The first one is generating these personas. Our prompts to generate these personas were inspired by a study where they gave these prompts to human subjects, finding that by giving it to human subjects, they also were able to surface racial stereotypes. And also this enables direct comparison between our generated personas and the human written responses. The second part is marked words, which is a method to identify the words that distinguish marked groups from unmarked ones, which I'll elaborate on shortly. The benefit of this is that we get really specific stereotypes and patterns without having to rely on any specific lexicon. So the marked words method draws upon the soci-linguistic concept of markedness which states that there is an unmarked default and any group that differs from that default is linguistically marked so for instance the word man or sorry the word warrior is usually associated with men so when people are describing a warrior who is a woman they'll usually actually specify one man warrior and mark the term with woman. And more broadly, dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked, while the marginalized groups are usually marked. So in our method, we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are. And then we compare the personas using the fighting words method, which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to... what the unmarked and marked groups are. And then we compare the personas using the fighting words method, which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group. So for instance, for the personas of black women, we would do fighting words and compare the log odds ratios against both white personas and man personas, because those are two corresponding unmarked groups. Now for some results. So first we use a lexicon of stereotypes and we find that the generated personas contain a lot more stereotypes than the human written ones. However, when we actually look at the distribution of the words in the lexicon, we find very different things. So while the generated personas have much higher rates of the lexicon words, the human written ones have a much wider distribution of words, while the stereotype words that are in the generated personas are really just the words tall and athletic. So really just only the positive or at least non-negative ones. And in fact, this lexicon doesn't really capture many of the harmful patterns that we saw in the earlier slides well at all. So instead, to do that, we'll turn to the results from our marked words method to show how these positive-seeming words facilitate stereotypes and essentializing narratives. In our analysis, we reveal how these seemingly positive portrayals reflect harmful patterns. First, for mark groups, the top words include things like culture, tradition, In our analysis, we reveal how these seemingly positive portrayals reflect harmful patterns. First, for marked groups, the top words include things like culture, tradition, proud, and exotic. And these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm. This contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups. Furthermore, there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words, especially for women of color. So for example, the words describing Latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous, which connect to a trope of tropicalism. For Asian women, the words are things like petite and delicate and silky, which connects to a long history of Asian women being hypersexualized, seen as very docile and submissive, and so on. And finally, for Black women, we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient. This connects to an archetype that people have called the strong Black woman archetype. And while it sounds like positive at first glance, there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these demographics to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles. So rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles, it puts pressure on those people to overcome them, which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people, among other harms. More broadly, we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives. So based on these patterns, we conclude with three recommendations for model owners. First, we should, as researchers, be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives. We should also be using intersectional lens to study biases and you learners. First, we should, as researchers, be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives. We should also be using intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that. And finally, there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because, for instance, like these positive stereotypes, we don't know if it's because there is some sort of like weird, overly excessive value alignment going on. like these positive stereotypes, we don't know if it's because there is some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on, or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns. We just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency. Thank you so much for listening. Have a good time at ACL."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 2, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hello, I'm James Finch. And I'm Sarah Finch. And today we'll tell you all about ABCeval, a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational AI. This work was done by the Emory NLP Lab, led by Professor Gino Choi at Emory University, and in collaboration with Amazon Alexa AI. So let's say that you just developed a dialogue model, and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art. The common practice is to use human evaluation, such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better, or to rate conversations given a Likert scale. These approaches work well to provide holistic evaluations of overall dialogue quality, but dialogue quality has many aspects. Therefore, you might want to evaluate multiple dimensions of chat quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer-grained level. One approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality, such as the relevance of model responses, using existing comparative or Likert scale methods. However, we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation. Our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors, such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself. We call this approach annotating behaviors in chat, or ABC eval in short. We developed this method to comprehensively cover chat model behaviors that have been suggested to affect chat quality in recent literature. APC eval a chat model ignores its partner or says something irrelevant, contradicts itself or its partner, hallucinates incorrect facts or violates common sense knowledge, and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy. To determine what kind of evaluation is most effective, we selected four state-of-the-art and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy. To determine what kind of evaluation is most effective, we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human-bot conversations per model using ABC eval. For comparison, we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods, Likert ratings on the turn level, Likert ratings on the dialogue level, and dialogue level pairwise comparisons. For each of the existing methods, we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions. From our analyses of these evaluation results, we found that ABC eval behavior labels are overall more reliable than labels collected by existing methods, as measured by inter-annotator agreement on 100 doubly labeled conversations. In addition, ABC eval labels are more predictive of the overall conversation quality compared to metrics produced by existing methods, as shown by this simple linear regression analysis. For example, eval labels are more predictive of the overall conversation quality compared to metrics produced by existing methods, as shown by this simple linear regression analysis. For example, you can see how measuring the proportion of turns with self and partner contradictions explains 5% and 10% of conversation quality respectively, while the average Likert consistency scores explain only 4% or less. Finally, we checked whether each evaluation metric captures a unique aspect of chat quality using a stepwise linear regression. You can see how the combination of all ABC eval metrics explains over 25% of conversation quality, and as you remove the metrics one at a time, most of them result in losing a decent amount of information about the quality. On the other hand, the combination of all turn-level Likert metrics explains far less of the quality, and fewer of these metrics carry unique information. These reliable, informative, and distinct ABC eval metrics enable us to evaluate conversational AI with a higher resolution than previous methods are able to achieve. You can see that in the results of our experiment that several challenges still remain and have been precisely quantified. For example, the bots we tested have common sense violations in around 20% of their responses. They produce irrelevant information in around 15% of the responses, and they contradict themselves or their partner around 10% of the time. With the rapid pace of improvement in the field, many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted. However, this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models. We hope ABC Eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction, and we look forward to seeing how conversational AI will advance in the coming months and years. Thank you for watching."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 3, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hello, my name is Vasudha and I am a Computer Science PhD candidate at Stony Brook University. I would like to present our work accepted into ACL 2023 as a long paper, Transfer Learning for Dissonance Detection, addressing the Rare Class Challenge. We begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language. Simply put, cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent. Such as this example, where a person states, I know that cigarettes could kill me, and then goes on to say, I grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting. This belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance. Further, mentioning that I don't think I could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a consonance relationship. While dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision making, they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations. So why does this matter? Studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people, track trends in belief, values, and attitude changes in population. High cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help understand people's mental health better. Studying dissonance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups. Finally, cognitive dissonance is important to understand personal cognitive styles of individuals and helps us understand decision-making processes better. To the goal of creating a cognitive dissonance resource, we conducted a large-scale annotation of dissonance relations. We used a dissonance-first approach as seen in the flowchart here. Tweets were parsed using a PDTV parser, and pairs of discourse units were annotated according to the guidelines that are described in our paper. As seen here, dissonance was only found in 3.5% of the annotated pairs. On collecting around 1000 examples of discourse unit pairs, we ran training for an initial classifier, trained only on 43 examples of dissonance. To no surprise, the classifier performed not much better than chance. Given the low occurrence of dissonance and absence of any prior such data set, we are facing the problem of absolute rarity. To alleviate this, we experiment over combinations of transfer learning and active learning to annotate such that more dissonance samples can be collected over lesser annotation runs, lowering the overall annotation costs while improving dissonance detection. Since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all, we start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks. We transfer from two different tasks. Topic independent dissonance stance classification, a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of PDTB since these two are closely related to the the conception of consonants and dissonance, and we call them CEE here. We find that on transferring, the zero-shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance, with the best with AUC.62. Further, on iteratively updates the model by training. round of active learning and annotations. Cumulative accumulates all the data collected from active annotations so far, whereas iterative updates the model by training on the latest set of data collected. Over the different strategies, we found that cumulative performed equal or better than iterative across the board. Next, to improve the number of dissonance examples, we use a probability of rare class strategy to select mostly examples that are highly likely to be dissonant by the current model at any round of AL. We compare this to the other state-of-the-art strategies, although the difference is small. Note that the performance is significantly lower for random. On further rounds of AL with two best strategies, we improved distance classification AUC to 0.75, which is the best performance that we have on the task so far. We also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators. We find that PRC has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class. However, the annotators also find the examples difficult. In summary, we find that PRC is a simple AL strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting AL with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks and helps In summary, we find that PRC is a simple AL strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting AL with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly. We also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain, whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update.

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 4, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hello everyone, I'm Akshata and today my co-author Martin and I are presenting our work, The Kipma Steps, evaluating knowledge integration from multiple sources. This work is a collaboration between McGill University, Mila and Microsoft Research. National language understanding models draw on a variety of knowledge sources, such as knowledge contained in their parameters, usually acquired via pre-training, and knowledge given in inputs at inference time. Recent works in tasks like question answering show that models can use pre-trained time knowledge to solve the task. But natural language understanding often requires knowledge that is also supplied at inference time. For example, in the sentence, John saw the newly elected president on TV. Pre-trained parameters can contain information about what presidents do and what a TV is, but they cannot reliably know who this incident-specific entity John is or who the new president is because the president might have changed since pre-training. Therefore, successful models for knowledge-intensive NLU tasks require the ability to integrate and use both pre-trained time and inference time knowledge. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration. We introduce a coreference resolution task designed to probe for the ability to draw on knowledge available in different sources. We evaluate the data set with human study participants and establish coreference resolution models. Here is an example from our data set. Servin is a judge. Kia is a baker. Servin and Kia met at a park. After a long day at work deciding cases in a law court, he was happy to relax. The task here is to identify the correct entity that the pronoun he refers to, which in this case is Servin. The resolution of a given pronoun requires two types of information. First, entity-specific knowledge such as survey is a judge. And second, background knowledge such as judges decide cases in law courts. Generally, background knowledge is learned during the pre-training of large language models, while entity-specific knowledge is typically observed at inference time. We vary the availability of these two pieces of information such that it may either be found in a single source or in multiple sources. We have defined three settings of KITMOS. First, we have the typical setting, background-pretrain, where background knowledge is assumed to be available at pretrain time. Second, there's a background the background both setting, where background knowledge is available both at pre-training time and inference time. Lastly, the background inference setting, where both knowledge types are available only at inference time. This last setting is especially interesting, since it simulates the case where the background knowledge necessary to solve a task is not part of the pre-trained data of models, for example because new occupations have developed since the time of pre-training. Here's an example of how we control the availability of facts and true sources. In the background pre-trained setting, we assume that the background knowledge politicians seek elected seats in government is contained in the pre-trained parameters. And in the 3-inch-time context, we provide the anti-specific knowledge that Chichester is a politician. In the background both setting, we additionally provide not only anti-specific, but also background knowledge about politicians in the inference time context. In the background inference setting, we provide the fictional occupation Meritur instead of politician, because Meritur is unlikely to be contained in the pre-trained parameters. We evaluate the dataset both with human study participants and established coreference resolution models. In this figure we show the results of the best performing models on the most difficult variant of the background pre-trained setting. Without task-specific training on KITMOS, both models do not perform well. When trained on KITMOS, however, both C2F and BFQF perform significantly better than the random choice. This suggests that when trained on general co-reference resolution datasets, models learn to exploit surface cues, which are not useful when testing on KITMOS where such cues have been removed. Additional experiments with fictional knowledge indicate that even the best performing models cannot reliably integrate background knowledge provided only at inference time. To summarize the main takeaways of our paper. Many co-referenced resolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task specific training. However, with task specific training, some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources. Still, even the best performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrated backward knowledge presented only at inference time.

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 5, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hi, I'm Sara Papi from the University of Trento and Fondazione Bruno Kessler and I will briefly introduce the Attention as a Guide for Simultaneous Speech Translation paper that is a joint work with Matteo Negri and Marco Turchi. What is simultaneous speech translation? Simultaneous speech translation or SimulST is the process of translating spoken language into a text in another language in real time, enabling cross-language communication. And what are the problems of the current simulST models? Specific architectures are usually trained, introducing additional modules to be optimized. Long and complicated training procedures, for example, involving different optimization objectives, and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes, for example training a model with an average of 1 second latency and another one with 2 seconds latency and so on. So what is our solution? First to use already existing offline SD models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for SimulSD. Use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific parameters. And leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the attention mechanism between audio input and textual output, that is the cross-attention mechanism. And you can see an example on the right. Our solution is to propose EDAT or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to. A word is emitted if the attention is not concentrated, that is, its sum is below a certain threshold alpha, towards less lambda speech frames, meaning that the received information is enough stable. For example, if we receive a speech chunk containing I'm going to talk about and our model predicts the translation in German and we will look at the cross-attention weights, we will see that the first two words points to the earliest received speech frames, while the last word points to the last received speech frames, i.e. lambda speech frames. This means that the first two words will be emitted, while since the sum of the cross-attention is above a certain threshold alpha, we will not emit the last word and we wait for another speech chunk. If we go on and we receive another speech chunk and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights, we will see that no word points to the last lambda speech frames. This means that these three words will be emitted. If we look at the main results of a dot, we plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware average lagging that accounts for the model's computational times to predict the output. So we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot, but also we want that they are shifted on the left. And we compare with proper strategies that are also applied to offline models, that are the wet-key strategy and the local agreement. And we compare also with the state-of-the-art architecture specifically tailored for simultaneous speech translation. These are all the results of the simultaneous speech translation strategy on German and we see that ADDOUT outperforms all the strategies applied to offline models, since the curves are shifted over the left. And we also see that if we consider the actual elapsed time or the computational aware time, ADAT is the fastest strategy. If you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models. If you want to discover more results, read our paper. We also released open source, the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work. Thanks for your attention."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 6, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hello everyone, my name is Zhu Heng. Today I'm going to present our paper, Do kernel 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023? Let's get started. Our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the NER task. We observed that models have been using Kano 2003 to develop NER for almost 20 years, and this naturally raises several problems. Firstly, can these models generalize to modern data? And when we develop new taggers, what is needed for good generalization. At the same time, if we do observe poor generalization, what causes the performance drop of these models? To investigate these problems, we developed the Kano++ dataset. This is a dataset that we collected from Reuters News from 2020 and then annotated them with same Cono2003 annotation guidelines. We then fine tuned over 20 models on Cono2003. We evaluated them on both the Con in F1 to assess the generalization of each model. So what is needed for good generalization? Through our experiments, we found that there are three main ingredients that are needed. The first one is the model architecture. Through our experiments, we found that the transformer models normally generalize better to new data. The second ingredient is the model size. We found that usually larger models lead to better generalization. And last but not least, we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task. Here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization. To our next question, what causes the performance drop of some models? We had two hypotheses. The first one is adaptive overfitting, which is overfitting caused by reusing the same test set over and over again, and this is usually manifested as the diminution returns on the new test set. The second hypothesis is temporal drift, which is the performance degradation that is caused by the increasing temporal gap between the train and the test data. For adaptive overfitting, we saw that from the graph on the right, the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one. This means that every unit of improvement that we made on CONO 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on Kano++, which means that there is no diminishing returns. And this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed. So what about temporal drift then? For temporal drift. And this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift. Our conclusion is that for good generalization, we would need a better model architecture, larger model size, as well as more fine-tuning examples. And these go hand-in-hand. We can't just have one ingredient but throughout the others. At the same time, we also found that the performance drop here is caused by temporal drift, and kind of surprisingly, it is not caused by adaptive overfitting, even though Carnal 2003 has been used for over 20 years. So going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper, do Carnot 2003 taggers still work in 2023? And we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes. We hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalizations of the models. And lastly, please make sure to check out our paper, our dataset, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact me. Thank you so much."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 7, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hi, welcome to our presentation of d.plain, a new corpus for German text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level. My name is Regina Stodden and I will guide you through the first part of the presentation. Let's first define text simplification. Text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group, as people with reading problems or non-native speakers. To train a text simplification model, we require parallel pairs of text, for example of documents or sentences. In the example here, you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex German sentence and its translation into plain language. To simplify the sentence different techniques are possible as you can see in the example, such as lexical substitution, claustellation, claustellation reordering or insertion of words. We now propose our new corpus dplane. Because in the recent years, there were some problems with existing corpora. So for example, these corpora here are too small to train a taxonification model on. The other three models which are proposed in recent years are all automatically aligned, which means they can be error-prone in their alignments. Therefore, we propose our new corpus dplane, which is split into two subcorporas, dplane-apa and dplane-web. dplane-apa is based on use texts. In the plain APA, we aligned 483 documents all manually. It results in roughly 30,000-13,000 parallel sentence pairs. For DeepLaneWeb, this corpus includes different domains and we also align all of these 750 documents on the one hand manually and on the other hand with automatic alignment methods. and we also align all of these 750 documents on the one hand manually and on the other hand with automatic alignment methods. In total, we result in 30,450 sentence pairs. We analyzed our sentence pairs a little bit more, so for example, on the type of simplification. As you can here the Bible texts are much stronger simplified than for example the news text or the language learner texts on all level regarding for example lexical simplification, structural simplification or the overall level of simplification. Furthermore you can see that our De Plplane corpus has a high priority of different simplification transformations. So, for example, in the d.plane API corpus, we have much more reorderings and word additions than we have in the d.plane web corpus. On the other hand, in the web corpus, we have much more rephrasing. So, let's now see what we can do with this corpus. Hello, I am Omar and now I will talk about the use cases for our dataset D-plane. So for the first use case, we can evaluate automatic alignment methods. In the recent years there has been a lot of alignment methods but but in the context of machine translations, where we have two parallel documents written in different languages, and we want to extract alignments of sentences in two parallel documents having the same language, having the same content but they are on a different complexity levels. And now as we have our dataset dplane which have manually aligned sentences we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed alignment methods and we did some adaptations to the proposed methods and we have published all these adaptations and the codes to run our experiments in the paper at the end we concluded that the best alignment automatic alignment method to use for texts for German text simplification is the method of math align and you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper the second use case that we showed in our paper is a case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text. We have fine-tuned two different models. We have finebased long-impart to produce sentence-level simplifications. You can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper. We concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we proposed those results as a benchmark, a base benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future. Thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference. Thank you."}

I'm here to introduce our work, Distilling Script Knowledge from Large Language Models for Constraint Language Planning. In everyday life, humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of guaranteed scripts. However, previous work mainly focuses on planning for the abstract. A good planner should write scripts for the first time. the goals of planning. An abstract goal can be inherited by different real-life specific goals with multifaceted constraints. A good planner should write scripts that are reasonable and faithful to constraints. In this paper, we firstly evaluate and improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models. Since no data set of specific goals exists to support our study, we have to acquire these goals first. As shown in the table, we extend the abstract goals with multifaceted constraints for human in the loop data acquisition using InstructGPT. We sample 100 specific goals and evaluate the scripts generated from large-language models. This table reports the overall accuracy of the results. We find that all large-language models achieve unsatisfactory results on planning for specific goals. Then, we conduct detailed analysis to investigate why learning models fall. Results in the figure show that the semantic completeness in generated scripts is acceptable, but the faithfulness to the constraints cannot be guaranteed. We dug into more fine-grained topic categories of constraints, depending on working how. The heatmap in the figure shows that the planning performance of instructive TPDs varies considerably for girls of different categories. Previous studies have shown that, the output quality of light-logging models falls in high variance, leading to bad performance. Thus, we adopt the idea of overgenerated Z-filter to improve generation quality. We first show constraint types with examples for instruct GPT, and obtain specific goals based on the seed abstract goals. Then, instruct GPT overgenerates key scripts for specific goals. Next, a filter model is developed to select the feasible scripts. We convert scripts and goals into instructGPT embeddings and calculate cosine similarity and similarity scores to measure semantic similarity. In addition, we award the script that contains the keywords of the target constraint. We only keep the script if the target goal scores the highest in the goal set. With our method, InstructZBT can generate scripts of higher quality. Our method greatly improve the planning ability, both in semantics completeness and faithfulness to the constraint. Since large-language models are costly to deploy, it's essential to enable language planning ability of smaller and specialized models. Creating dataset is an essential step to its end. However, previous studies do not enable planning for specific goals, and manual dataset annotation is expensive. Thus, we follow the idea of symbolic knowledge distillation to distill constrained language planning datasets from large language models. We apply our method for building a dataset of constrained language planning, named as CodeScript. In total, we generate 55,000 specific goals with scripts. To ensure the quality of validation and test sites. we asked cloud-sourced workers to find revised incorrect samples. This figure shows the constraint distribution of code script. We find code script shows high applaudism in the generated specific goals. With code script, we can treat smaller but specialized models for constraint language planning. We find that TFI of Antune on the cost rate can generate square root of 0. With CodeScript, we can treat smaller but specialized models for constrained language planning. We found that T-file functions on CodeScript can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models, indicating that smaller models can support larger models when properly trained on suitable datasets. In summary, we established the constrained language planning problem. We evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language models and develop an over-generating filter method research on language planning. Thanks for your time. Please find more details of CodeScript in our paper."}

In this presentation, we first talk about language modeling in healthcare. Then, we will present the main contribution of our article. We introduce the first biomedical model in French, named Dr. BERT, which is based on Roberta, and trained on NACHOS, which is a dataset of medical crawled data from the web. We also introduced a comparison of model with multiple pre-training settings and data sources. Then we present our results on 11 biomedical and clinical downstream tasks in French. And finally we conclude about the experiments and give you more details about how to access to the models. medical and clinical downstream tasks in French. And finally, we conclude about the experiments and give you more details about how to access to the models. Since its release in 2018, BERT has become one of the most effective approach to solve natural language processing tasks and offer huge performance gain compared to historical static and contextualized methods such as Word2Vct, fast text, or NWO. Since then, this model has been adapted to many other languages, like in French with Camembert, and other domains like biomedical with permit-bert and bio-bert, and on clinical with clinical-bert, but mostly in English. Specialized models for other languages are scarce and are often based on continual pre-training due to the lack of in-domain data. However, French didn't have any open-source models for biomedical until now. So we asked ourselves questions about what is the most appropriate data sources for a wide range of usage and those current data are good substitution for clinical data to answer this question we compare dr bert with our schubert model which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that our house after all we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data Is it 4 GB, 8 and 4 GB of RAM. A first version of Schubert, which is a clinical model, with 4 GB of sentences taken from clinical notes. And a final version of Schubert, with a mix of 4 GB subset of NACHOS and 4 GB of clinical notes. In addition to this comparison, we introduced three models trained on continual pre-training to analyze the impact of pre-training strategy. One based on the weight of Camembert and trained on 4 GB subset of NACHOS. Another also based on Camembert but trained this four gigabytes permit belt by bio birth and clinical birth. The evaluation highlights the... 38 GB, Camembert Oscar 4 GB, Camembert CCnet 4 GB, Pumatbert, BioBERT, and ClinicalBERT. The evaluation highlights that models perform best on the task with data of the same nature as those on which the model has been trained. However, we can observe that data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile. We also observe that using more data translates into better performance. In overall, from scratch pre-training seems to obtain higher performance on most of the tasks. However, our experiments on continual pre-training, using the weight and tokenizer of Permet-BERT, trained on the 4-gigabyte subset of NACHOS, show comparable results to those obtained with Dr.BERT 4 GB from scratch, which is not the case for the model based on Camembert weights and tokenizer, which suffer from stability issues. Finally, as a conclusion, our proper system offers better performance on 9 of the 11 don't-trim tasks and surpasses globally the results of the generic model. In conclusion, our proper system offers better performance on 9 of the 11 don'trim tasks, and surpasses globally the results of the generic model here, Camembert. We also observe that more specialized data is better, but it doesn't scale well. All the pre-trained models obtained from NACHOS are freely available on UGIMFACE and all the training scripts are on our GitHub repository. So thank you for this presentation and we are looking forward to actions at the poster session in Toronto."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 10, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hi, I'm Xiangbin, PhD student at the University of Washington. Today I'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks, tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair NLP models. So language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data. Political news media are well covered in their pre-training data. According to a survey of the C4 corpus, we can see that New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, Huffington Post, etc. are well covered in language model training data. This has created a mixed blessing for language model applications. So on one hand, they were able to learn from diverse perspectives, which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas. On the other hand, these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream task applications. To this end, we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks, specifically by asking the following questions. First, how do we evaluate the political leaning of language models, and what role does pertaining data might have on such political biases? Secondly, how do language models with different political leanings actually perform on downstream tasks, and whether that might result in fairness issues in NLP applications? So specifically, we first proposed to prompt language models with different prompt formats using the political questionnaires, such as the political compass test. This ensures us to do automatic evaluation well grounded in political science literature. So some preliminary results demonstrate that first language models do have varying political leanings. They occupy all four quadrants on the political compass. We can also see that GPT-4 is the most liberal language model of them all, and GPT theories are generally more so. they occupy all four quadrants on the political compass. We can also see that GPT-4 is the most liberal language model of them all, and GPT theories are generally more socially liberal than BERT theory and its variants. Secondly, we aim to investigate to which extent the political biases of language models are actually picked up from training data. So we conduct a controlled experiment by further pre-training language model checkpoints on six different partisan corpora separated into news and social media further divided into their political leaning. By further pre-training language models on such partisan corpora, we can see that the ideological coordinates of the language model also correspondingly shift. For example, for Roberta, further fine-tuned, further trained on the left-leaning Reddit corpus, we can see a substantial liberal shift in terms of its political biases. And we also try to investigate whether language models can pick up the polarization that's prevalent in our modern society. So we divide pre-training corpora into pre-45th president of United States and after 45th president of United States, we separately pre-train language models on the two different temporal corpora. We can see that language models generally had a political leaning that is further away from the center after 2017. So this indicates that language models can also pick up the like polarization in our society. So last but not least, we evaluate language models with different political leanings on hate speech detection and fake news detection to NLP applications that often involve language models and could have very significant implications. So we see that if we investigate the per category performance, that is to say, if we separate the performance into different demographics or political meaning of news media, we can see a pattern that, for example, for hate speech detection, left-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups, however, are worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups in our society. And vice versa, right-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting white and men, however, worse at detecting hate speech targeting black, LGBTQ+, and other minority communities. Similar trends also happen for fake news detection, where we see that left-leaning language models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political leaning and vice versa. This, we further show many qualitative examples to see that language models with different political leanings do give different predictions to hate speech and misinformation examples based on their social category. There are a bunch of more examples in the appendix To further highlight different predictions to hate speech and misinformation examples based on their social category. There are a bunch of more examples in the appendix to further highlight that. This indicates that there is a fairness issue that is very pressing regarding the political biases of language models. For example, if right-leaning language models were to be fine-tuned on hate speech or misinformation or whatever and deployed to a popular social media platform, this would mean that people with opposite political opinions might be marginalized. on hate speech or misinformation or whatever, and deploy to a popular social media platform, this would mean that people with opposite political opinions might be marginalized, and the hate speech targeting minority groups might just run rampant without any control. So this has sounded the alarm for us to acknowledge and tackle the fairness issues resulted by language model political leanings. So a little bit of discussion. We would also like to highlight that we expose the unique dilemma regarding language model political biases. It's like between Scylla and Charybdis. So if we do not sanitize the political opinions in language model training data, the bias will propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks, ultimately creating fairness issues. issues. do try to sanitize somehow, we will also risk censorship or exclusion, and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data. So it's kind of like the electric trolley problem. Okay, great. I think that's pretty much all I have for today. Thank you for your time."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 11, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hi everyone, I'm Kostav Sinha and I'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our ACL 2023 paper, Language Model Acceptability Judgements Are Not Always Robust to Context. This is a joint work with John Gauthier, Aaron Mueller, Kanishka Mishra, Karen Fuentes, Roger Levy, and Adina Williams. So in this work, we revisit the minimal pair paradigm. So the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments, which can also include grammaticality, like blimp, syntax, gym, or acceptability in terms of stereotypes, such as Krauss pairs. And in this minimal pair paradigm, the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence, and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence. And then the whole process of the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence. The current MPP pipeline basically doesn't allow us to evaluate models acceptance towards longer sentences. These days, large language models are coming up with longer and longer context windows. So it we revisit the datasets themselves and then we recreate sentences by choosing like acceptable or unacceptable sentences from those data sets. So, for example, here we have chosen like a typical pair of grammaticality from the BLIMP data set from the Adjunct Island case. And what we do is that to recreate like longer sequences and which are acceptable and which has the same matching of the grammatical structure, we extract grammatical sentences from Adjunct Island and then we add it as a prefix to both the acceptable query and the unacceptable query. So we can do the same thing by choosing unacceptable sentences from the same matching and that could could also be used to test the model's acceptability. And we can also do the same by choosing sentences from a different subset or a different data set. So that is what we call as the mismatch scenario. So here, the sentences are still coming from relevant data sets, but it's not from the same data set that you evaluating with. And we can do the same for an acceptability case. Finally, we can choose sentences from a completely unrelated domain, such as Wikipedia. So this will tell us like whether the model's acceptability judgments are actually impacted by any context, context,'s like completely irrelevant to the sentence that we are looking at. So how does the model do? So first we look at the Wikipedia sentences, which are completely irrelevant to the current query pair. And there we find that the MPP judgments are mostly robust for arbitrary context length. We increase the context length toward up to 1024 to max out OPT and GPT-2 models. And we saw here in the orange dotted line, the MPP judgments are relatively stable. Now what happens when we choose sentences from the same data set? So here we are choosing or creating sentences from acceptable and unacceptable domains from the same blimp or syntax gem data set. And there we see that the MPP judgments either increase or decrease significantly when you add either acceptable prefixes or unacceptable prefixes. But when we match the structure, that is when we when you add either acceptable prefixes or unacceptable prefixes. But when we match the structure, that is when we choose the sentences from the same phenomena in blame-person-text-gym, we see a massive increase or a massive decrease of the MPP judgment for the model, depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable. Now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window. So why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much? So we did a series of analysis where we tried to like put up the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure, but adding like noise to the input. And after doing like several of these perturbations, we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change it course in terms of how it shows us the MPP judgment trend. Basically, we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways. That is, when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain, we see similar increase in all the perturbations. And when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain, we see decrease in MPP judgments. we see similar increase in all the perturbations. And when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain, we see decrease in MPP judgments in similar fashion. So the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences. And the MPP evaluation, the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window. Please read our paper for more details of our experiments. Thank you for listening."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 12, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hello, I am Dawei, a PhD student at Saarland University in Germany. In this video, I would like to present our recent work, Weaker than you think, a critical look at weakly supervised learning. This is joint work with Xiao Yusheng, Mario Smusbach, and Gia Steffen, and Dietrich Klackow. I'd like to begin with a brief introduction to weak supervision and weakly supervised learning. In weak supervision, we do not manually label the data. Instead, we label the data using weak labeling sources, such as simple heuristic rules, knowledge bases, or low-quality crowdsourcing, as illustrated in the figure on the right. When compared to human annotations, the weak annotations are much cheaper, yet they are also noisy, meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect. If we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data, the neural networks tend to memorize the labeled noise and do not generalize. In weekly supervised learning, training algorithms are proposed to robustly train neural networks under such label noise so that the trained models still generalize well. In recent works in WSL, so WSL stands for weekly supervised learning, a common claim is that people say that they only train models under the weekly label data and achieve high performance on clean test sets. Technically, this claim is not wrong, but there is a catch, which is three research questions. questions. First, is clean validation data do we need? Finally, should we only use the clean samples for validation, or there are better ways to utilize them? We addressed these research questions in our work, and our findings are as follows. First, we find that interestingly, recent WSL methods indeed require clean validation samples to work properly. Otherwise, there is a large performance drop. As shown in this figure, if there are no clean validation samples, then the trained models cannot generalize beyond the original weak labels, meaning that the training is pointless. This indicates that WSL approaches actually require cleanly labeled data to work properly, and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked. Our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help WSL approaches to achieve better performance, as shown in the figure on the left. Typically, we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance. But that's not the end of the story, because if we either way decide to access clean samples, then training on them directly will even achieve better performance. The red figure shows the performance difference between fine-tuning approaches, which are directly applied on the clean data, and WSL approaches, which use the clean data for validation only. As we can see, if we have 10 samples per class, direct fine-tuning starts to beat WSL approaches. Finally, the performance improvement claimed in previous WSL approaches can be easily achieved by allowing to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples. As we can see from the figures, the Van Linden model, termedW initially underperforms more complicated WSL methods like cosine. However, if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean samples, then FTW performs equally well as other methods. So in practice, there's no reason to choose more complex WSL methods which require more computation time and disk space. To summarize, we showed that recent WSL approaches require clean, manually annotated samples for them to work properly. Their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated. Our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows. First, report the model selection criteria. For example, report if the model selection is done well clean validation samples. Second, WSL approaches should be compared with few short learning baselines, as work on clean samples. Third, continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in WSL. Finally, we have open-sourced our code. You can find it via the QR code on this slide. Please feel free to check it out. Thank you and enjoy the conference."}

This is joint work with my colleagues from Google Translate. Parm is a 540 billion parameters large language model presented last year, in 2022. It's trained on a large collection of text comprising 780 billion tokens. In the time of publication, it achieves state-of-the-art in hundreds of NLP tasks. In this work, we present the first systematic study of large language model prompting for machine translation. We evaluated the translation capability of such models using the best practices of the IMT community. This involves using the latest test sets to avoid an overlap of the test data with the training data of the language model. We compare two state-of-the-art systems, so the best performing systems or the WMT evaluation. We use state-of-the-art neural IM metrics and additionally also show expert-based human evaluation results. Finally, we provide some recommendations for prompt selection strategies. The prompting has a big influence on the performance of LLMs for translation. As we can see in a simple experiment where we use one-shot prompting and provided two different prompts for each sentence. The majority of sentences, 516 out of 1000, the difference observed is of more than one blur point. And this can go in extreme cases up to 40 blur points. So it's important to select a good prompting strategy. In our experiments, we settled for a five-shot prompting strategy, where we just mark each sentence that we provide to the system with the language it's in. So in this example here, where we perform translation from German into English, the German sentences are marked with German colon and the English translations with English colon. We saw that the actual form of the prompting doesn't have a big influence in the case of several-shot prompting. It's crucial for zero- and one-shot prompting, and when we go, as in our case, to five-shot prompting, there is nearly no difference to the actual form of the prompting. It's the examples that carry most of the weight. The summary of our experimental results is that the example quality is more important than the similarity to the source sentence. So it's important The summary of our experimental results is that the example quality is more important than the similarity to the source sentence. So it's important to select the examples from high quality translations. In particular, we compare the selecting prompts from the training data of the WMT evaluations or the dev data. The dev data is much more curated and with higher quality that the trained data that it's more noisy and the results show a better performance when using the dev data. Nevertheless, specialized state-of-the-art systems have a substantial advantage over the Palm translations, but Palm comes pretty close to a commercial system. In our case, we chose to evaluate with Google Translate. The insights that we gained from the email analysis that we performed using the MQM framework is that the fluency of Palm is comparable to state-of-the-art systems, but the main difference comes from the accuracy. So in particular, the most common errors are omission errors. So it seems that Palm chooses to produce a better sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are animated in the translation. However, the style awkward category for Parm is lower than for the state-of-the-art systems, which is an additional signal that Parm provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy. and that's it for this really short overview for more fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy. And that's it for this really short overview. For more details, please come to the full presentation of the paper. Thank you very much."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 14, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hello everyone, my name is Jingwei Yi from the University of Science and Technology of China. It's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video about paper, Are You Copying My Model? Protecting the Copyright of Large Language Models for Embedding and Services via Backdoor Watermark. Let's first introduce the background about embedding and services. Currently, large language models such as GPTT, LAMA, PALM are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation. Embedding as Services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various NLP tasks. For example, OpenAI offers a GPT--based embedding API. However, recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding and provide similar services. Therefore, it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services. To protect the copyright of embedding as services, one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider service and detect whether another service contains the watermark. The watermark method needs to meet the following properties. First, the method should be applicable to embedding as services. Second, the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embeddings. Third, the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily. Finally, the watermark need to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process. Existing works can be broadly classified into four categories. However, these methods either not applicable to embedding as services or lack of transferability. details of our EmbeddingMarker. EmbeddingMarker contains two main steps, watermark injection and copyright verification. Before these main steps, we first select a trigger set. The trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval. We assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it. In watermark injection, we first define a target embedding. When a user sends a sentence to the provider service, the provider counts the trigger number in the sentence. The provided embedding is the weight summation of the target embedding and the original embedding. The weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence. When the number of triggers in the sentence is greater than m, the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding. Copyright verification is to detect whether a model behind another service contains the wordmark. We first construct a backdoor and a benign dataset. Backdoor dataset contains sentences of which all words belong to the trigger set, while all words in the sentences of benign dataset do not belong to the trigger set. Then the provider requests embeddings from the stealer service with the dataset. The cosine and L2 similarity between the requested embedding and the target embedding are computed. We compute the similarity difference between benign and backdoor datasets, which is defined as delta cosine and delta L2. Meanwhile, we also apply KS test and use its p-value as the third metric. We conduct experiments on four datasets, AGnews, Mind, SSD2, and Eraspam. We assume the provider apply Wikitext dataset to count word frequency. The results on four datasets show that our embedded marker can have great detection performance while keep great utility for downstream tasks. We also validate the covertness of the provided embedding by visualizing the embedding of sentences on four datasets via PCA. The legend of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence. As shown in the figures, it's hard to distinguish between the backdoor embeddings and normal embeddings. That's all, thank you. Welcome to discuss with us."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 15, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hello everyone, my name is Ying, and my colleague Zhiyang and I will be presenting our research on Multi-Improvement, Improving Multi-Model Serial Short Learning via Instruction Tuning. So with the advances in large language models, many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way. Recently, many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions. However, most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks, while computer vision and multimodal tasks have been left out. Therefore, in this work, we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multimodal pre-trained models can actually improve generalization to unseen multimodal tasks. Additionally, at the time of our research, we discovered a considerable discrepancy in availability of instruction dataset between NLP and multimodal. There exist more than 1,600 language-only instruction tasks. However, there is no large-scale publicly available multimodal instruction task. Therefore, this motivate us to build a multimodal instruction tuning dataset. Here we present MultiInstruct, the first multimodal instruction tuning benchmark dataset that consists of 62 diverse multimodal tasks covering 10 board categories. These tasks are derived from 21 existing open source datasets datasets, and each task is equipped with 5 expert written instructions. For investigating multimodal instruction tuning on our proposed dataset, we take OFA, a unified multimodal pretrained model, as our base model. OFA uses a unified vocabulary for language, image tokens, and the coordinates of a bounding box. Here we show some example instances from our multi-instruct dataset. To unify the processing of a various input and output data type, we follow the method from OFA and formulate all the tasks in a unified sequence-to-sequence format, in which the input text, images, instruction, and bounding boxes are represented in the same token space. Okay, now I'm going to talk about multi-modal instruction tuning. So for the training dataset, we use 53 tasks from 9 groups for training, and we sample 10,000 instances per task. For testing, we reserve the entire common sense reasoning group for testing and we select additional five tasks from VQA and miscellaneous group. We use all the instances in the test split for each task. In addition, we randomly sample 20 tasks from the test split of natural instruction as unseen tasks for NLP. So we use a pre-trained OFA large model as a base model. During training, we mix all the instances for all the tasks. Each instance is randomly combined with one of its five instruction templates. During tests for each task, we conduct a total of five experiments by evaluating the model using one of the five instructions in each experiment. We report the mean and max performance and the standard deviation of the performance across all five experiments. If the task is a multi-model classification task, we report accuracy. If it's a multi-model generation task, we report root L. For an RP task, we root jl as well we also introduced a additional evaluation metric called sensitivity so this measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task regardless of the slight variation in the wording of the instruction here is our main main result. As we can see, instruction tuning can significantly improve OFA's performance on scene multi-model tasks. Also transfer learning from natural instruction data sets can benefit instruction tuning. Here we can see as the amount of tasks increase, the model achieves performance and in the meantime lower sensitivity. We also did one experiment, we used one instruction versus five instructions. As we can see, using more instructions can improve the model's overall performance and reduce its sensitivity a lot. So this shows the effect of different fine-tuning strategy on the model sensitivity. As we can see, by transfer learning from natural instruction dataset, the model can achieve much better sensitivity compared to the original OFA model. We also can see transfer learning from natural instruction Instruction dataset can help OFA to achieve much better performance on the Nitro Instruct dataset. Overall, we propose the first large-scale multi-model instruction tuning dataset. We significantly improve the zero-shot capability of OFA, and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits. We design a new metric called sensitivity. So one more thing, we are collecting a much larger multimodal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional variant language tasks and we will release them soon. This is a QR code for our data and model. Thank you."}

As shown in this figure, we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models, to SQL, Lambda, or FunQL, etc. Existing cross-lingual semantic parsing models are separately proposed and evaluated on dataset of limited tasks and applications.

The Chinese is missing and because of coverage on certain mini representations, the lambda calculus is missing or they're only evaluated on certain neural model. For example, there's only one single model to evaluate them. So to this end, we propose exampler. We provide a uniform dataset exampler for cross-linked semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and meaning representations. It contains nine datasets in various domains, five semantic parsing tasks, eight meaning representations, and 22 natural languages in 15 language families. And to better evaluate our benchmark, we consider the six settings for training and evaluation. The first one is translate test. We use Google Translate API to translate source to the target language, then use monolingual model to train an evaluation. And for example, we train the English model on English query. And during inference, we translate the German query using API to English and then use the trained model to predict the SQL. And we also test monolingual model. In this setting, the source language is the same as target language. For example, German to German or English to English. We also test monolingual few-shot setting by training monolingual models with only 10% of training data. And we test multilingual model, which we train one multilingual model for all languages. For example, we put the German, English, Chinese queries together to train a multilingual model. And during inference, we can use this model to translate German queries or Chinese query or etc. And we also consider cross-lingual zero-shot and few-shot transfer. We train on one source language and transfer to another language. So during training, we train it on English query or the combination of English and German few-shot queries to train a multilingual model and predict the SQL output. And we also find many interesting results. So regarding analysis of monolingual models, we evaluate on two groups of models, including encoder PDR, which stands for multilingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders, such as XLMR plus PDR and BERT plus PDR. And we also evaluate encoder-decoder models, which is multilingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models, such as MBART and MT5. We found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine datasets. And we evaluate on MT5 and XLMR plus PDR on multilingual setting. We found that encoder-decoder or encoder-PDR can be improved by training in a mixture of various languages. And we found it is because most of the major natural languages can obtain performance gain, except that English performance drops in seven datasets and only gains in three datasets. I think this is known as curse of multilinguality. We also compare the cross-lingual performance gap. In this figure, the blue line is cross-lingual few-shot transfer. The orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer, while the green line is the monolingual setting. We found that by comparing the green and orange line, we found that for zero-shot setting, the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant. And by comparing blue and orange line, we found that for few-shot setting, the transfer gap is shortened rapidly. We also find some other interesting findings. For example, encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results. Portraying on English natural language can significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages. And we found multilingual language models such as CODIS and BLUE are still adequate for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks. To sum up, we built Examplar, a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and main representations. We conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative types of multilingual language models. And our results show many interesting findings and etc. And welcome to visit our paper and code. Thanks for listening."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 17, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hi, my name is Adam Szpilkowski and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination. As you may know, there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches. So, for example, in the universal dependencies, the structure of the coordination Lisa, Bart and Maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure, so in this case Lisa. A similar approach is assumed in Igor Milchuk's meaning text theory, where again, the whole coordinate structure is headed by the first conjunct. So these two approaches are asymmetric, right? They are the single out one of the conjuncts. Now, there are also symmetric approaches to coordinate structures such as the Prague approach, the conjunction-headed approach assumed in Prague dependency treebanks, where coordinate structures are headed by the conjunction. So we get dependencies from n to all the conjuncts. And finally there's also a multi-headed approach that's used for example in Dick Hudson's word grammar where, so to say, all conjuncts are heads of the coordinate structure. a multi-headed approach that's used for example in the cutson's word grammar where so to say all conjuncts are heads of the coordinate structure so we get dependencies from the governor here loves to all conduct separately these are bartons making now the aim of this paper is to produce two and against the asymmetric structures of coordination like these two. Okay, the argument is based on the principle of dependency length minimization that I will explain on the basis of these examples. So in English, as you might know, direct objects prefer to be close to the verb while adjuncts may be further away, right? so March read it yesterday is fine because the direct object it is close to the verb while March direct objects prefer to be close to the verb, while adjuncts may be further away, right? So March read it yesterday is fine because the direct object it is close to the verb, while March read yesterday it is much worse, right? Because here between the verb and the direct object, there is an adjunct yesterday. However, this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long, because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct. This is illustrated here. So both these sentences are fine. March read this absolutely fascinating book about the BCS today. It's okay. In a way, instead of it, we have this long NP. But it's also okay to say March read yesterday this absolutely fascinating book about bees. So the reasoning here is that this is possible because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that direct objects should be next to the verb, it satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization, which says that shorter dependencies are preferred. So these two trees only show the length of the crucial dependencies, so the ones that are not constant among these two structures. So here we have a dependency from red to the adjunct of length seven measured in words and from red to book of length four. So together it's 11. When you move, when you swap these two constituents, the sum of these two dependencies becomes six, right? So instead of 11, six, much shorter. That's why this sounds quite okay. It violates one principle, but it satisfies another one. Okay, so what we did, we extracted various statistics about coordination from the enhanced version of the Penn Treebank and see the paper why we didn't use universal dependencies. and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter. we didn't use universal dependencies and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length the length difference so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows, the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger. Right. So the proportion is bigger of the left short conjunct. But what's novel in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left or absent right so the government is on the left in this example i saw bart and lisa so it's the governor it's on the left uh it's absent in the second example homer came and sneezed here we have coordination of two verbs and there's no outside external governor right so in such cases uh the left conjunct prefers to be shorter the more so the uh the difference between the two conjuncts. However, when the governance on the right is here, left governs the coordination, t and net, this effect disappears. So we show that by measuring length in characters, that's the first column in syllables, the middle column and in words the right column. So I'll concentrate on the right one. What we see here is that when the governor is on the left, the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words. And the same is observed when there is no governor, as in coordination of sentences. But when the governor is on the right, this tendency disappears. And we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two. So see the paper for the full agreement and arguments, sorry, and talk to us about the poster session. Thank you."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 18, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hello! My name is Kaio Yin, and I will be presenting our work titled, When Does Translation Require Context? A Data-Driven Multilingual Exploration. This work was done in collaboration with Patrick Fernandes, Emmy Liu, Andre F.D. Martins, and Graham Newbig. So a lot of translations depend on context. For example, how would we translate mole in this sentence? Well, if the previous sentence was, things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out, then mole refers to a spy. But if the previous sentence was, could it be anything serious, doctor? Then mole refers to a birthmark. So depending on context, the meaning of the word changes, and therefore its translation changes as well. However, evaluating how well models can translate cases like this is pretty hard. Firstly, because only a small portion of translations depend on context, which makes corpus level metrics like BLUE unable to capture these translations. And some people have suggested targeted evaluation on context dependent translations, but these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages, since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation. In this work, we tried to answer these two questions. First, when does translation require context? And second, how well do models handle these cases? To answer the first question, we started by measuring how much a word depends on context-during translation. In the previous work, we introduced CXMI as a measure for context usage by machine translation models. And this is done by measuring how much information the context C provides about the target Y, given the source X. You can think of CXMI as the information gained from giving context to the model. In this work, we extend CXMI to point-wise CXMI, which can measure context usage at the sentence level or at the word level. We can think of words that have high P6MI as ones that require context for translation. Now we analyze words with high P6MI to look for patterns between these words. And we perform our analysis on transcripts of TED Talks that have been translated from English to 14 different languages. We perform our analysis at three different levels. First, we look at parts of speech tags that have high means PCXMI. And this allows us to find, for example, dual pronouns in Arabic that have relatively high PCXMI. And this can be explained because English doesn't have dual pronouns, so you need context to determine if a pronoun is dual when translating into Arabic. And similarly, we find that certain languages also require context when we want to choose the appropriate verb form. We then look at vocabulary items that have high PCSXMI averaged over all of its different occurrences. This helps us identify cases like the one here, where in Chinese you need context to translate proper nouns to make sure that you're using the same translation within the document. And similarly, we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality. And finally, we look at different individual tokens that have high PCXMI. And this allows us to identify phenomena that cannot really be captured by the word itself, but that's rather expressed in the sentence structure, such as ellipsis resolution. So now we use our findings from our analysis to design a benchmark for document-level translation. For each of the five discourse phenomena we identified, we create taggers to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon, and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse-aware, or MUDA, tagger. We can then use the tagger to identify words that pertain to the phenomenon, and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse-aware, or MUDA, tagger. We can then use the tagger to identify words that pertain to the phenomenon, and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse-aware, or MUDA, tagger. We can then use the tagger to identify words that pertain to the phenomenon, and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse-aware, or MUDA, tagger. We can then use the tagger to identify words that pertain to the phenomenon, and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse-aware, or MUDA, tagger. We can then use the tagger to identify words that pertain to the phenomenon, and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse-aware, or MUDA, tagger. We can then use the tagger to identify words that pertain to the phenomenon, and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse-aware, or MUDA, tagger. We can then use the tagger to identify words that pertain to the phenomenon, and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse-aware, or MUDA, tagger. We can then use the tagger to identify words that pertain to the phenomenon, and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse-aware, or MUDA, tagger. We can then use the tagger to identify words that pertain to the phenomenon, and we languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena. We then use the MUDA tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation. And we apply our translation metrics of choice on the context-dependent examples that the Muda tagger has identified. And finally, we use our benchmark as well as other metrics to evaluate different models on the document-level machine translation. First of all, when we use corpus-level metrics, so for blue blue we find that context-agnostic models have the best performance, but then if we use COMET, context-aware models perform best. And if we use word-f measure, then models with or without context have comparable performance. This again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best document-level translation system if we use corpus-level metrics alone. Now we use the Muda benchmark to evaluate models, and we find that context-aware models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context for certain discourse phenomena, such as formality and lexical cohesion. But these models are not much better than models that did not use context on other phenomena like ellipses, pronouns, and verb form. So this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation. We also compared different commercial systems, and our benchmark shows that DeepL is usually more accurate than Google Translate for document-level translation. To summarize, we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context. And then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation, which can help us identify which discourse phenomenon models can handle well or not, and which translation systems are good at document-level translation. Thank you so much for your attention. See you in Toronto!"}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 19, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hi everyone, I'm Jenny, a first year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, and today I'll be presenting your work, Anal Positionality, Characterizing Designed Biases of Datasets and Models. This work was done in collaboration with some folks at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI, namely Sebastian Sante, Ronan Labrasse, Katarina Aranica, and Martin Sapp. So let's start off by imagining that you're working for a newspaper and you're sifting through comments under your news article trying to remove toxic content. You might turn towards a popular API like Perspective API for toxicity detection, and this works really well if you're Carl Jones, where Perspective API is able to detect correctly toxic instances. But that's not really the case for Aditya Sharma, where perspective API is really not as sensitive to offensive terms that are more common in Indian contexts. This is an example of a design bias, where we see systematic performance differences of technology between populations. Design biases like the one that we just saw before might occur due to the positionality of the NLP researchers and model developers. Positionality is simply the perspectives that people hold as a result of their demographics, identity, and life experiences. This is a concept widely used in critical studies, specifically in feminist and queer academic spaces. And as a researcher, positionality can influence the research process and its outcomes and results because it can change the decisions that researchers make. And so one question that people might ask is, do data sets and models have positionality? And we're not trying to say that models themselves and data sets themselves have demographic identities and life experiences, but they do aggregate judgments and opinions of real people and can thus represent that models and cells and data sets themselves have demographic identities and life experiences but they do aggregate judgments and opinions of real people and can thus represent certain positionalities over others so prior work has suggested some anecdotal evidence of having positionality such as cultural gaps and models and data sets as well as theoretical definitions of model positionality. However, these works really don't look at comparing end users with the datasets and models themselves. Studying model and dataset positionality is increasingly important as NLP tasks become more subjective and socially oriented. It's challenging to characterize how these positionalities are skewed because not all decisions are documented and many models are hidden behind APIs. So to study dataset and model positionality, we actually compare the annotations with real users with existing datasets and models. We do this through our framework NL positionality. Our framework works in two main steps. The first step is to re-annotate datasets with diverse annotators. And we opt to do this over looking at the demographics of original datasets annotators, because usually only a few annotators annotate each instance and because demographics are rarely collected and shared. And so we opt to re-annotate data to get many annotators per instance, and to get a rich set of demographic data. We then take the annotations by demographic and compare them to the models and datasets using a Pearson's R correlation score. And thus, our framework actually differs from annotator disagreement literature by comparing end users with models and data sets, predictions, and labels, as opposed to looking at just annotator agreement or modeling annotator distributions. Our framework is largely enabled through Lab in the Wild, an online crowdsourcing platform from our HCI collaborator. And Live in the Wild is an online experimentation platform where we can recruit diverse volunteers. crowdsourcing platform, former HCI collaborator. And Lab in the Wild is an online experimentation platform where we can recruit diverse volunteers compared to the platforms like MTurk, which largely have participants from the US or India. And further, Lab in the Wild still is able to get high quality data. We host two tasks on Lab in the Wild, one of them being social acceptability. And the way this works is that participants will read a situation from the social chemistry dataset, and then they'll write how socially acceptable a situation is. Afterwards, to stay engaged in the study, they can compare their responses to an AI and others. We then compare these annotations with social chemistry, Delphi, and GPT-4. We then replicate a very similar setup for the toxicity and hate speech detection test. compared these annotations with social chemistry, Delphi, and GPT-4. We then replicated a very similar setup for the toxicity and hate speech detection task, where they'll read an instance from DynaHate and write whether they think it's an instance of hate speech. We then compared these annotations with DynaHate, Perspective API, Rewire API, Hate Roberta, and GPT-4. Our study, in the end, amassed over 16,000 annotations from over a thousand annotators from 87 countries. So now we're better equipped to answer who do NLP data sets and models align with the most. We find that there is positionality in NLP. For example, we find that data sets and are most aligned to English-speaking countries. So for the GPT-4 social acceptability analysis, we find that it's most aligned to Confucian and English-speaking countries. We find that dyna-hate is also most aligned to English-speaking countries. We also find most additional alignment with people who have a college education. So for GPT-4 in the social acceptability task, we find that it's most aligned to people with a college education or graduate school education. And we find the same for Dynahate, where it's most aligned to people with a college education. However, when models and data sets are aligned to specific populations, some are inevitably left behind. An example of this is that data sets and models are less aligned to non-binary people compared to the men and women counterparts. We find this in the GPT-4 social acceptability task as well as the DynaHEAT task analysis as well. So given that there is positionality in NLP, what can we do about it? So we have a few recommendations for this. First one is keep a record of all relevant design choices throughout the research process. And the other is to do NLP research with the lens of perspectivism. Our third recommendation is to build specialized data sets and models within four specific communities. And a good example of this is the Masakane Initiative. I mean, we want to emphasize that inclusive NLP isn't just making, you know, all technologies work for everyone. And so that concludes our presentation. But if you'd like to learn more, feel free to check out our dashboard for the most updated analysis results and our paper. Thank you."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 20, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hi, I'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection, in which we introduce the Alt Entities corpus. My name is Jawad Hosseini, and this is a joint work with Philip Radlinski, Sylvia Parity, and Annie Lewis. Our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice. Consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or I got a feeling here a user wants to select between one of these two songs the most obvious thing is to use a direct reference for example by saying the name of the song easy on me or its position the first one but sometimes an indirect reference is more appropriate to have a more natural conversation this could happen when the user cannot remember the name of the song or the pronunciations are too similar to each other and hard to disambiguate or when the user wants to specify a preference here are some example indirect differences for example the newer one or the song that's not energetic this is an important problem in conversational systems and also for benchmarking LLM's entity understanding we're not aware of a public dataset, a large-scale public dataset for a task, so we collect one using crowd annotation. Our dataset covers three different domains, music, books, and recipes. Our dataset collection methodology emphasizes informality using a cartoon completion setup. The cartoon has three speech bubbles. Our dataset collection methodology emphasizes informality using a cartoon completion setup. The cartoon has three speech bubbles. In the first bubble, Bob says, remember that song we were listening to yesterday? And with that, Bob sets the dialogue context. In this in the second speech bubble, Alice says, do you mean easy on me or I got a feeling? Which is the alternative question. And in the third speech bubble, Bob uses an indirect reference to select one of these entities, for example, the newer one. We provide the first and second speech bubbles automatically, but the third one is filled in by the annotator. The first speech bubble is chosen from a few manual prompts per domain. The second one, which is the alternative question, is generated as follows. we always use a simple template do you mean a or b generated as follows we always use a simple template do you mean A or B where A and B are samples from Wikipedia here are the different sampling methods we've used when we move higher in the list the entities become more similar to each other and it's usually harder to make the disambiguation the first one is uniform at random the second one is when the entities have similar titles for example two books with the name the return the third one is when they have similar descriptions on Wikipedia and finally when for example the same genre or the same artist for example. When we show this alternative question to the administrators they know the name of these entities but they don't necessarily know about the entities so what we do is that we show some background knowledge about the two entities for songs we simply show a google search link to each song and then ask the annotators to listen to at least some of each song and read about each song here's for example the google search result for the song Easy on Me. For the recipes and books domain we show some background text from Wikipedia. For recipes we additionally show their images again from Wikipediaikipedia so that the annotators know how they look like then we ask the annotators to pick one of these entities for example here the first one and describe them using three to five indirect referring expressions for example the one with the piano music here are some examples from our data set for example the one without words not the one with the 12 year old 12 year old boy or the fictional one or comes from Azerbaijan and so on the identities corpus has 6 000 alternative questions across three domains and it has 42 000 indirect referring expressions results with t5x has 6,000 alternative questions across three domains and it has 42,000 indirect referring expressions. Results with T5XLARGE model are summarized below. If the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators then the accuracy is really high it's around 92 to 95 percent but this is not realistic if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if then the accuracy is only 60% so there's a lot of room for improvement. We've also shown that the models are domain generalizable. Here is a link to our dataset. Thanks for"}
