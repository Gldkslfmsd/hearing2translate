So these two approaches are asymmetric. They single out one of the conjuncts."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 37, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Now there are also symmetric approaches to coordinate structures, such as the Prague approach, the conjunction-headed approach assumed in Prague dependency treebanks, where coordinate structures are headed by the conjunction."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 38, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we get dependencies from end to all the conjuncts."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 39, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And finally, there's also a multi-headed approach that's used, for example, in Dick Hudson's word grammar,"}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 40, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "where, so to say, all conjuncts are heads of the coordinate structure. So we get dependencies from the governor, here loves, to all conjuncts separately. These are Barton's making."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 41, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Now, the aim of this paper is to produce a novel argument for the symmetric structures of coordination like these two and against the asymmetric structures of coordination like these two."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 42, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Okay, the argument is based on the principle of dependency-length minimization that I will explain on the basis of these examples."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 43, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So in English, as you might know, direct objects prefer to be close to the verb, while adjuncts may be further away, right? So March, read it yesterday is fine because the direct object it is close to the verb."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 44, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "While March read yesterday, it is much worse, right? Because here between the verb and the direct object, there is an adjunct yesterday."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 45, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "However, this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long, because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 46, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "This is illustrated here. So both these sentences are fine. March read this absolutely fascinating book about the BCS today. It's okay. The way instead of it, we have this long NP."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 47, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "But it's also okay to say March Read Yesterday, this absolutely fascinating book about bees."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 48, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So the reasoning here is that this is possible because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that direct objects should be next to the verb,"}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 49, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Wojciech Czaja- It satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization which says that shorter. Wojciech Czaja- shorter dependencies are preferred."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 50, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So these two trees only show the length of the crucial dependencies, so the ones that are not constant among these two structures,"}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 51, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So here we have a dependency from read to the adjunct of length seven measured in words and from read to book of length four. So together it's 11."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 52, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "When you move, when you swap these two constituents, the sum of these two dependencies becomes 6, right? So instead of 11, 6, much shorter. That's why this sounds quite okay, right? It violates one principle, but it satisfies another one."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 53, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Okay, so what we did, we extracted various statistics about coordination from the enhanced version of the Penn Treebank and see the paper why we didn't use university dependencies."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 54, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Mateusz Piorkowski- And the statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left contracts tend to be shorter also salt and pepper and salt measured in syllables."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 55, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length difference."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 56, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows, the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger. Right. So the proportion is bigger of the left short conjuncts."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 57, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "But what's novel in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governess on the left are absent."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 58, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So the governor is on the left in this example. I saw Bart and Lisa, so is the governor is on the left."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 59, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "It's absent in the second example. Homer came and sneezed. Here we have coordination of two verbs and there's no outside external governor. So in such cases, the left conjunct prefers to be shorter, the more so the bigger the difference between the two conjunctions."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 60, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "However, when the governance on the right is here, left governs the coordination, tel and net, this effect disappears."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 61, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we show that by measuring length in characters, that's the first column in syllables, the middle column in words, the right column. So I'll concentrate on the right one."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 62, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "What we see here is that when the governor is on the left,"}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 63, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "The tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words. And the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences. But when the governor is on the right, this tendency disappears."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 64, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 65, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So see the paper for the full agreement and arguments, sorry, and talk to us about the poster session. Thank you."}

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 71, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "To this end, we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks, specifically by asking the following questions."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 72, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "First, how do we evaluate the political leaning of language models and what role does pertaining data might have on such political biases?"}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 73, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Secondly, how do language models with different political limits actually perform on downstream tasks and whether that might result in fairness issues in NLP applications?"}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 74, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So specifically, we first proposed to prompt language models with different prompt formats using the political questionnaires, such as the political compass test. This ensures us to do automatic evaluation well grounded in political science literature."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 75, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So some preliminary results demonstrate that first language models do have varying political leanings. They occupy all four quadrants on the political compass."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 76, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "We can also see that GPT-4 is the most liberal language model of them all, and GPT theories are generally more socially liberal than BERT theory and its variants."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 77, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Secondly, we aim to investigate to which extent the political biases of language models are actually picked up from training data."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 78, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we could conduct a controlled experiment by further pre-training language model checkpoints on six different partisan corpora separated into news and social media further divided into their political leanings."}

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 581, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So the marked words method draws upon the sociolinguistic concept of markedness, which states that there is an unmarked default and any group that differs from that default is linguistically marked."}

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 589, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So while the generated personas have much higher rates of the Luxon words, the human written ones have a much wider distribution of words, while the stereotype words that are in the generated personas are really just the words tall and athletic."}

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 600, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "There's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these demographics to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 601, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles, it puts pressure on those people to overcome them, which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people, among other harms."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 602, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "More broadly, we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives."}

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 605, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And finally, there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 606, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Because for instance, like these positive stereotypes, we don't know if it's because there is some sort of like weird..."}

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 654, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "To alleviate this, we experiment over combinations of transfer learning and active learning to annotate such that more dissonance samples can be collected over lesser annotation runs, lowering the overall annotation costs while improving dissonance detection."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 655, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all, we start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 656, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "We transfer from two different tasks. Topic independent dissonance stands classification, a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic."}

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 666, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "We also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators. We find that PRC has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class. However, the annotators also find the examples difficult."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 667, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "In summary, we find that PRC is a simple AL strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting AL with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 668, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "We also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain, whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update."}
