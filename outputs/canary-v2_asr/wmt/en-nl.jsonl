I would recommend going to your local coffee roastery, get your favorite coffee and it needs to be ground for something like French press or a coarse table salt. So that comes in here where we have the super fine metal filter and then you just want to sit everything on top here. Okay water. So with the valve closed we're going to put this on the top and fill it with filtered water at best. Now you can put ice cubes in here as well to make sure it's a cold extraction, or you can put the whole thing in the fridge as well afterwards. And I recommend using about seven to ten grams per 100 millilitres of water. Once that's done, you can put the lid on."}

There's different sizes of taper candles, but there's a simple workaround if you have a taper candle and a holder that you really want to use. And that is simply to melt the bottom side of your taper candle with a lighter or a match and let the wax drip into the taper candle holder. And as it's still hot, press it into the holder and it's actually going to melt into the holder and kind of stand in the exact position that you want it to be. And let's just say you make it a bit crooked when you sti you stick it in. Don't worry, you can pull it right out, remelted it. And at some point, you're going to get it straight enough where you like it and it's going to be stuck in the holder pretty well. My next tip is to remove sticker residue from your decor pieces. Now, I know that there's the whole low dryer tip to kind of like heat it up and remove the sticker, which is great, but I always feel like there's still like a little bit of film up."}

So you're just going to dig in, give it a little mix, and then you're just going to take a generous amount and it's foli skin. Now this is best to hold in your hands like that since it's not a facial scrub with granules. So once you have it in your hands, you're just going to use it and just rub the face as if you're using soap on the face. So just exfoliate your face. If it gets dry, throw it out, dip back in and take up a fresh batch and exfoliate your face with this, okay?"}
