{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 6, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "We now propose our new corpus dplane. Because in recent years there were some problems with existing corpora. So, for example, these corpora here are too small to train a taxonomication model on."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 7, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "The other three models which I proposed in recent years are all automatically aligned, which means they can be error prone in their alignments."}

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 21, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And now as we have our dataset dplane which have manually aligned sentences, we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed alignment methods."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 22, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And we did some adaptations to the proposed methods and we have published all these adaptations and the codes to run our experiments in the paper."}

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 34, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "As you may know, there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches. So, for example, in universal dependencies, the structure of the coordination Lisa, Bart, and Maggie."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 35, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure, so in this case, Lisa."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 36, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Similar approach is assumed in Igor Milchuk's meaning text theory where again the whole coordinate structure is headed by the first conjunct. So these two approaches are asymmetric, right? They single out one of the conjuncts."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 37, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Now there are also symmetric approaches to coordinate structures such as the PRUG approach, the conjunction headed approach assumed in PRUG dependency tree banks where coordinate structures are headed by the conjunction."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 38, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we get dependencies from end to all the conjuncts."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 39, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And finally, there's also a multi-headed approach that's used, for example, in Dick Cutzman's word grammar."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 40, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "where, so to say, all conjuncts are heads of the coordinate structure. So we get dependencies from the governor, here laughs, to all conjuncts separately. These are Bart and Maggie."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 41, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Now the aim of this paper is to produce a novel argument for the symmetric structures of coordination like these two and against the asymmetric structures of coordination like these two."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 42, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Okay, the argument is based on the principle of dependency length minimization that I will explain on the basis of these examples."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 43, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So in English, as you might, as you might know, our direct objects prefer to be close to the verb while adjuncts may be further away, right? So march read it yesterday is fine because the direct object it is close to the verb."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 44, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "While March read yesterday it is much worse, right? Because here between the verb and the direct object is an adjunct yesterday."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 45, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "However, this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the edge."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 46, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "This is illustrated here. So both these sentences are fine. March read this absolutely fascinating book about the BC yesterday, I is okay, where instead of it we have this long NP."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 47, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "But it's also okay to say, Marge read yesterday this absolutely fascinating book about bees."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 48, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So the reasoning here is that this is possible because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that direct objects should be next to the verb."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 49, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "It satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization, which says that shorter dependencies are preferred."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 50, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So these two trees only show the length of the crucial dependencies, so the ones that are not constant among these two structures."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 51, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So here we have a dependency from read to the adjunct of length 7 measured in words and from read to book of length 4. So together it's 11."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 52, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "When you move, when you swap these two constituents, the sum of these two dependencies becomes six, right? So instead of eleven, six much shorter. That's why this sounds quite okay, right? It violates one principle, but it satisfies another one."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 53, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Okay, so what we did, we extracted various statistics about coordination from the enhanced version of the Pentry Bank and see the paper why we didn't use universal dependencies."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 54, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter, so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 55, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length difference."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 56, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows, the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger, right? So the proportion is bigger of the left short conjunct."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 57, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "But what's novel in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governates on the left are absent."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 58, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So the governor is on the left in this example. I saw Bart and Lisa, so it's the governor, it's on the left."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 59, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "It's absent in the second example, Homer came and sneezed. Here we have coordination of two verbs and there's no outside external governor, right? So in such cases, the left conjunct prefers to be shorter. The more so, the bigger the difference between the two conjuncts."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 60, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "However, when the governance on the right, as here, left governs the coordination Telenet, this effect disappears."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 61, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we showed that by measuring length in characters, that's the first column in syllables, the middle column, and in words, the right column. So I'll concentrate on the right one."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 62, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "What we see here is that when the governor is on the left."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 63, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "The tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words, and the same is observed when there is no governor, as in coordination of sentences, but when the governor is on the right, this tendency disappears."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 64, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 65, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So see the paper for the full agreement and arguments, sorry, and talk to us about in the post-session. Thank you."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 66, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hi, I'm Xiang Bin, PhD student at the University of Washington. Today I'm presenting our work from pre training data to language models to downstream tasks, tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair NLP models."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 67, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 68, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Political news media are well covered in their pre training data. According to a survey of the C four Corpus, we can see that New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, Huffington Post, et cetera are well covered in language model training data."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 69, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "This has created a mixed blessing for language model applications."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 70, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So on the one hand, they were able to learn from diverse perspectives, which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas. On the other hand, these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream task applications."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 71, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "To this end, we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks, specifically by asking the following questions."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 72, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "First, how do we evaluate the political leading of language models and what role does pre-training data might have on such political biases?"}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 73, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Secondly, how do language models with different political units actually perform on downstream tasks and whether that might result in fairness issues in NLP applications?"}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 74, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So specifically, we first propose to prompt language models with different prompt formats using the political questionnaires, such as the political compass test. This ensures us to do automatic evaluation well grounded in political science literature."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 75, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So some preliminary results demonstrate that first language models do have varying political meanings. They occupy all four quadrants on the political compass."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 76, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "We can also see that GPT 4 is the most liberal language model of them all, and GPT series are generally more socially liberal than BERT series and its variants."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 77, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Secondly, we aim to investigate to which extent the political biases of language models are actually picked up from training data."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 78, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we could conduct a controlled experiment by further pre-training language model checkpoints on six different party corporates separated into news and social media further divided into their political meanings."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 79, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "By further pre-training language models on such parts in corpora, we can see that the ideological coordinates of the language model also correspondingly shift."}

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 82, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And we also try to investigate whether language models can pick up the polarisation that's prevalent in our modern society."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 83, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we divide pre training corpora into pre 45th President of the United States and after 45th President of the United States, we separately pre train language models on the two different temporal corpora."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 84, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "We can see that language models generally had a political leading that is further away from the center after 2017. So this indicates that language models can also pick up the polarization in our society."}

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 96, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "This would mean that people with opposite political opinions might be marginalized and the hate speech targeting minority groups might just run rampant without any control."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 97, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So this has sounded the alarm for us to acknowledge and tackle the fairness issues resulting from language model political neighing."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 98, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So a little bit of discussion. We would also like to highlight that we expose the unique dilemma regarding language model political biases. It's like between Sila and Kryptidis."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 99, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So if we do not sanitize political opinions in language model training data, the bias will propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks, ultimately creating fairness issues."}

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 578, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And also this enables direct comparison between our generated personas and the human written responses."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 579, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "The second part is marked words, which is a method to identify the words that distinguish marked groups from unmarked ones, which I'll elaborate on shortly."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 580, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "The benefit of this is that we get really specific stereotypes and patterns without having to rely on any specific lexicon."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 581, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So the marked words method draws upon the sociolinguistic concept of markedness, which states that there is an unmarked default and any group that differs from that default is linguistically marked."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 582, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, for instance, the word man or sorry, the word warrior is usually associated with men.

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 584, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So in our method, we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 585, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And then we compare the personas using the fighting words method, which is basically using weighted logods ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 586, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So for instance, for the personas of black women, we would do fighting words and compare the law gods ratios against both white personas and man personas because those are the two corresponding unmarked groups."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 587, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Now for some results. So first we use a lexicon of stereotypes and we find that the generated personas contain much more stereotypes than the human written ones."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 588, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "However, when we actually look at the distribution of the words in the lexicon, we find very different things."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 589, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So while the generated personas have much higher rates of the Luxon words, the human written ones have a much wider distribution of words, while the stereotyped words that are in the generated personas are really just the words tall and athletic."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 590, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So really only the positive or at least non negative ones."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 591, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And in fact, this lexicon doesn't really capture many of the harmful patterns that we saw in the earlier slides well at all. So instead, to do that, we'll turn to the results from our marked words method to show how these positive seeming words facilitate stereotypes and essentializing narratives."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 592, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "In our analysis, we reveal how these seemingly positive portrayals reflect harmful patterns."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 593, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "First, for mark groups, the top words include things like culture, tradition, proud, and exotic. And these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 594, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "This contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 595, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Furthermore, there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words, especially for women of color. So, for example, the words describing Latino women include things like vibrant and curvacious."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 596, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "um, which connect to a trope of tropicalism. For Asian women, the words are things like petite and delicate and silky."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 597, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "which connects to a long history of Asian women being hypersexualized, seen as very docile and submissive, and so on."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 598, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And finally, for black women, we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 599, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "This connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype, and while it sounds positive at first glance."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 600, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these demographics to be resilient and strong against social obstacles."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 601, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So instead of actually working towards changing those obstacles, it puts pressure on those people to overcome them, which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people, among other harms."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 602, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "More broadly, we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 603, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So based on these patterns, we conclude with three recommendations for model owners."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 604, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "First, we should, as researchers, be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives. We should also be using intersectional lens to study biases and harms, because there are a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 605, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And finally, there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 606, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Because, for instance, like these positive stereotypes, we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 607, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other, like anti stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns."}

I would like to present our work accepted into ACL 2023 as a long paper, Transfer Learning for Dissonance Detection, addressing the Rare Class Challenge."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 641, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "We begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language. Simply put, cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 642, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "such as this example where a person states, I know that cigarettes could kill me, and then goes on to say, I grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting. This belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance."}

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 645, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So why does this matter? Studying cognitive distance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people, track trends and belief values and attitude changes in population."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 646, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "High cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help understand people's mental health better."}

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 649, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "To the goal of creating a cognitive dissonance resource, we conducted a large scale annotation of dissonance relations. We used a dissonance first approach as seen in the flowchart here."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 650, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Tweets were passed using a PATB parser and pairs of Discord units were annotated according to the guidelines that are described in our paper."}

To no surprise, the classifier performed not much better than chance."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 653, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Given the low occurrence of dissonance and absence of any prior such dataset, we are facing the problem of absolute rarity."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 654, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "To alleviate this, we experiment over combinations of transfer learning and active learning to annotate, so that more dissonant samples can be collected over lesser annotation runs, lowering the overall annotation cost while improving dissonance detection."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 655, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all, we start the active learning process by transferring weights from close-related tasks."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 656, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "We transfer from two different tasks, topic independent dissent stands classification, a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement, irrespective of topic."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 657, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of PDTB, since these two are closely related to the conception of consonants and dissonance, and we call them CE here."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 658, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "We find that on transferring the zero short performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with AUC.62."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 659, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Further, on iteratively fine tuning on both tasks, we find that fine tuning of CE tasks followed by further fine tuning on debate yields a much better zero shot performance. Thus, this is the model that we use to cold start the actual learning."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 660, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Next, we determine the best method to update a model with new data from each round of active learning and annotations. Cumulative accumulates all the data collected from active annotations so far, whereas iterative updates the model by training on the latest set of data collected."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 661, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Over the different strategies, we found that cumulative performed equal or better than iterative across the board."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 662, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Next, to improve the number of dissonance examples, we use a probability of rare class strategy, PRC, to select mostly the examples that are highly likely to be dissonant by the current model at any round of AL."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 663, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "We compare this with the other state of the art AL strategies that are commonly used in the community."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 664, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "We find that the proposed PRC strategy works better than other state-of-the-art strategies, although the difference is small. Note that the performance is significantly lower for random."}

{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 666, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "We also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators. We find that PRC has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class. However, the annotators also find the examples difficult."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 667, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "In summary, we find that PRC is a simple AL strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting AL with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly."}
{"dataset_id": "mcif_v1.0", "sample_id": 668, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "We also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain, whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update."}
