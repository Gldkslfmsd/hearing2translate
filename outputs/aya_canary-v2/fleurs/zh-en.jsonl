It calms the brain and helps relieve stress and anxiety. This pose is often used as a transitional posture in sun salutations and can be held for extended periods to build endurance.\n\n**Step-by-step instructions:**\n\n1. Begin on your hands and knees, aligning your wrists directly under your shoulders and your knees under your hips.\n\n2. Tuck your toes and lift your hips up and back, straightening your legs and pressing the soles of your feet into the mat.\n\n3. Form an inverted V-shape with your body, keeping your hands shoulder-width apart and your feet hip-width apart.\n\n4. Engage your core muscles to support your lower back and maintain a straight line from your head to your heels.\n\n5. Keep your neck long and relaxed, looking towards your navel or extending your gaze towards your feet.\n\n6. Hold this pose for several breaths, focusing on your breath and maintaining proper alignment."}
