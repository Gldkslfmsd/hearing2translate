In terms of accessibility for the disabled, it is also a significant challenge. When I went to the UK, I noticed that many sidewalks had designated paths for disabled individuals. However, upon returning to China, I saw that the roads were mostly filled with shared bicycles, and some signs were not very clear. For example, many elevators have buttons designed for blind people, but they are often missing. There are also some good features for hearing-impaired friends. In the UK, I often saw a small blue sign where hearing-impaired individuals could place their headphones to hear from a larger speaker. In China, I rarely see such facilities."}

This is not because China has an exceptionally small population of disabled persons but because these individuals often lack sufficient capabilities to go outdoors and adapt to society."}
